&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Programming from A to Z! &amp;ldquo;Programming from A to Z&amp;rdquo; is a course I teach at ITP. This playlist is anyone who would like to follow along online. This course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based data. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn server-side and client-side JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online. Influences and Inspiration for the Programming from A to Z class:Jackson Mac Low&amp;rsquo;s Wikipedia Page: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en&#34;&gt;https://en&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you prevent that? Unfortunately, we can&amp;rsquo;t use violence any more, but there are some other mechanisms. If they don&amp;rsquo;t know how much their coworkers are getting, they won&amp;rsquo;t raise salary questions for much longer. They will be emotionally attached to the place and it will be very difficult to leave, no matter how underpaid they will be. Brainwash them regularly by communicating how great your company is, how big its mission is, and how important their contribution is. Spend just a little on all those funny office things, and they will pay you back big time, through the ability to underpay your programmers. They simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how to buy insurance, how to plan a retirement fund, or even how to pay taxes. How do you become friends? Well, meet their families, invite them over for dinner at your house, give them birthday gifts-all those tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFC] Using DC in amdgpu for upcoming GPU Dave Airlie airlied at gmail.com Thu Dec 8 20:07:26 UTC 2016 &amp;gt; I can&amp;rsquo;t dig into details of DC, so this is not a 100% assessment, but if &amp;gt; you call a function called &amp;ldquo;Validate&amp;rdquo; in atomic commit, you&amp;rsquo;re very, very &amp;gt; likely breaking atomic. If &amp;gt; you want to improve shared code the only downside is that you can&amp;rsquo;t also &amp;gt; improve amd, but that&amp;rsquo;s not so much a problem for non-amd folks ;-) &amp;gt; &amp;gt; The problem otoh with the abstraction layer between drm core and the amd &amp;gt; driver is that you can&amp;rsquo;t ignore if you want to refactor shared code. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; - Another issue is that very often we unify semantics in drivers by adding &amp;gt; some new helpers that at least dtrt for most of the drivers. If you have &amp;gt; your own world then the impendance mismatch will make sure that amd &amp;gt; drivers will have slightly different semantics, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;gt; good for the ecosystem and kms - people want to run a lot more than just &amp;gt; a boot splash with generic kms userspace, stuff like xf86-video-$vendor &amp;gt; is going out of favour heavily. The trouble is that having your own world makes it harder for &amp;gt; everyone else to understand the amd driver, and understanding all drivers &amp;gt; is very often step 1 in some big refactoring or feature addition effort. Read up on the whole mac80211 problems we had years ago, where every wireless vendor wrote their own 80211 layer inside their driver, there was a lot of time spent creating a central 80211 before any of those drivers were suitable for merge, well we&amp;rsquo;ve spent our time creating a central modesetting infrastructure, bypassing it is taking a driver in totally the wrong direction.

&lt;p&gt;Deucher at amd.com Fri Dec 9 17:32:24 UTC 2016 &amp;gt; &amp;mdash;Original Message&amp;mdash; &amp;gt; From: Dave Airlie &amp;gt; Sent: Thursday, December 08, 2016 3:07 PM &amp;gt; To: Daniel Vetter &amp;gt; Cc: Wentland, Harry; dri-devel; Grodzovsky, Andrey; amd-gfx mailing list; &amp;gt; Deucher, Alexander; Cheng, Tony &amp;gt; Subject: Re: [RFC] Using DC in amdgpu for upcoming GPU &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I can&amp;rsquo;t dig into details of DC, so this is not a 100% assessment, but if &amp;gt; &amp;gt; you call a function called &amp;ldquo;Validate&amp;rdquo; in atomic commit, you&amp;rsquo;re very, very &amp;gt; &amp;gt; likely breaking atomic. It&amp;rsquo;s annoying since &amp;gt; &amp;gt; lots of code, and bugfixes have to be duplicated and all that, but it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;gt; &amp;gt; fairly easy to fix case-by-case, and as long as AMD folks stick around &amp;gt; &amp;gt; not a maintainance issue. If &amp;gt; &amp;gt; you want to improve shared code the only downside is that you can&amp;rsquo;t also &amp;gt; &amp;gt; improve amd, but that&amp;rsquo;s not so much a problem for non-amd folks ;-) &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; The problem otoh with the abstraction layer between drm core and the &amp;gt; amd &amp;gt; &amp;gt; driver is that you can&amp;rsquo;t ignore if you want to refactor shared code. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Given the choice between maintaining Linus&amp;rsquo; trust that I won&amp;rsquo;t merge &amp;gt; 100,000 lines &amp;gt; of abstracted HAL code and merging 100,000 lines of abstracted HAL code &amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll give you one guess where my loyalties lie. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve also wondered if the DC code is ready for being part of the &amp;gt; kernel anyways, what &amp;gt; happens if I merge this, and some external contributor rewrites 50% of &amp;gt; it and removes a &amp;gt; bunch of stuff that the kernel doesn&amp;rsquo;t need. If code trumps all, then why do we have staging? I understand forward progress on APIs, but frankly from my perspective, atomic has been a disaster for stability of both atomic and pre-atomic code. Are you basically telling us that you&amp;rsquo;d rather we water down our driver and limit the features and capabilities and stability we can support so that others can refactor our code constantly for hazy goals to support some supposed glorious future that never seems to come? What about right now? Maybe we could try and support some features right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-calloc-exist-https-vorpus-org-blog-why-does-calloc-exist&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vorpus.org/blog/why-does-calloc-exist/&#34;&gt; Why does calloc exist? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of its public API, calloc is different in two ways: first, it takes two arguments instead of one, and second, it returns memory that is pre-initialized to be all-zeros. So&amp;hellip; why does calloc exist, if it&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to these 2 lines? The C library is not known for its excessive focus on providing convenient shorthands! So that&amp;rsquo;s the first way that calloc cheats: when you call malloc to allocate a large buffer, then probably the memory will come from the operating system and already be zeroed, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to call memset. Calloc lives inside the memory allocator, so it knows whether the memory it&amp;rsquo;s returning is fresh from the operating system, and if it is then it skips calling memset. This only explains part of the speedup: memset+malloc is actually clearing the memory twice, and calloc is clearing it once, so we might expect calloc to be 2x faster at best. Numpy allocated the array using calloc, and then it wrote 1s in the diagonal&amp;hellip; but most of the array is still zeros, so it isn&amp;rsquo;t actually taking up any memory, and our 2 GiB matrix fits into ~60 MiB of actual RAM. Of course there are other ways to accomplish the same thing, like using a real sparse matrix library, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. Calloc exists because it lets the memory allocator and kernel engage in a sneaky conspiracy to make your code faster and use less memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-algorithm-did-microsoft-use-to-dither-color-in-early-versions-of-windows-http-retrocomputing-stackexchange-com-q-1887-621&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/q/1887/621&#34;&gt; What algorithm did Microsoft use to dither color in early versions of Windows? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Windows used the basic 16-color CGA palette, which included 4 shades of monochrome, and 12 basic colors, which later formed the basis of the &amp;ldquo;Web safe palette&amp;rdquo; that became popular during the early days of the Internet. The algorithm used back then was known as the Bayer dithering technique, otherwise referred to as ordered dithering. The basic idea was to generate a grid of threshold values in a mathematical arrangement that favors nearly consistent values equal distances from each other, which is what produces the cross-hatch effect. They also included some example source code written in PHP:. &amp;lt;?php /* Create a 8x8 threshold map &lt;em&gt;/ $map = array map(function($p) , range(0,63 ; /&lt;/em&gt; Define palette &lt;em&gt;/ $pal = Array(0x080000,0x201A0B,0x432817,0x492910, 0x234309,0x5D4F1E,0x9C6B20,0xA9220F, 0x2B347C,0x2B7409,0xD0CA40,0xE8A077, 0x6A94AB,0xD5C4B3,0xFCE76E,0xFCFAE2); /&lt;/em&gt; Read input image */ $srcim = ImageCreateFromPng(&amp;lsquo;scene. Basically, the entire thing was dreamed up by Bayer, and this algorithm dominated the market during the 4-bit era of computer graphics. 000000 #808080 #800000 #FF0000 #008000 #00FF00 #808000 #FFFF00 #000080 #0000FF #800080 #FF00FF #008080 #00FFFF #C0C0C0 #FFFFFF. Always dither from a full-color image, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;ll probably look even worse than you intended. Dithering in realtime is trivial for modern systems, as even classic 33mhz systems that ran Windows had no trouble implementing the Bayer dithering pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table partitioning is like table inheritance and reuses much of theexisting infrastructure, but there are some important differences. The parent is called a partitioned table and is always empty; it maynot have indexes or non-inherited constraints, since those make nosense for a relation with no data of its own. Each partition has animplicit partitioning constraint. Multiple inheritance is notallowed, and partitioning and inheritance can&amp;rsquo;t be mixed. Tuple routing isn&amp;rsquo;t yet supported for partitions which are foreigntables, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle updates that cross partition boundaries. Listpartitioning is limited to a single column, but range partitioning caninvolve multiple columns. A partitioning &amp;ldquo;Column&amp;rdquo; can be anexpression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-am-tired-of-makefiles-https-dmitryfrank-com-blog-2016-1211-i-am-tired-of-makefiles&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dmitryfrank.com/blog/2016/1211_i_am_tired_of_makefiles&#34;&gt; I am tired of Makefiles &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cesanta, we use Makefiles to build our firmwares, libraries, and perform other things. I want my incremental builds to be reliable, and I want to be able to reuse my Makefiles as needed. A &amp;hellip;. Now, we have a project app with a separate Makefile, and we want to use mylib. We don&amp;rsquo;t want the app target to always get rebuilt. The app won&amp;rsquo;t be rebuilt, even though we want it to. My point is that if the author of makefile wants some variable to be overriddable, they should just use FOO ?= foo. There are plenty of other issues, some of them require ancient wisdom to write Makefiles which are correct, but I got used to most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s consider this question: if you&amp;rsquo;re a developer working for software company, does that company own what you do in your spare time? Every software company is going to want to own the copyright to the code that its employees write for them, so no software company can accept the &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo; way the law works. So before you hire this developer, you agree, &amp;ldquo;Hey listen, I know that inventing happens all the time, and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to prove whether you invented something while you were sitting in the chair I supplied in the cubicle I supplied or not. I don&amp;rsquo;t just want to buy your 9:00-5:00 inventions. I want them all, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to pay you a nice salary to get them all,&amp;rdquo; and she agrees to that, so now you want to sign something that says that all her inventions belong to the company for as long as she is employed by the company. So every software company tries to own everything that its employees do. Hmmm. OK, what if my employer is a small company making software for the legal industry. All of them need to purchase your copyright and patents without having to prove that they were generated &amp;ldquo;On the clock,&amp;rdquo; so they will all try to do this, unless the company is being negligent and has not arranged for appropriate contracts to be in place, in which case, the company is probably being badly mismanaged and there&amp;rsquo;s another reason not to work there. If you leave and start a competitive company or even a half-competitive company, we will use this contract to bring you to tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Enter Coding, a stack-based markup language. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding has 2 stacks, one for strings and another for HTML output. Parentheses push to the string stack; for example, would push asdf to the string stack. The standard library has a function S that can push from the string stack to the output stack. &amp;gt;: Pops top string stack element, wraps with a tag name, and pushes to output stack. Adds an attribute to the top output stack element using the popped top string stack element. S: Push the top string stack element to the output stack in text form. Se: Push the HTML string form of the top output stack element to the string stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function get&lt;T, K extends keyof T&gt;(obj: T, propertyName: K): T[K] let x = ; let foo = get(x, &amp;ldquo;Foo&amp;rdquo;); // has type &amp;lsquo;number&amp;rsquo; let bar = get(x, &amp;ldquo;Bar&amp;rdquo;); // has type &amp;lsquo;string&amp;rsquo; let oops = get(x, &amp;ldquo;Wargarbl&amp;rdquo;); // error! Mapped Types. Mapped types are definitely the most interesting feature in TypeScript 2.1. Mapped types are produced by taking a union of literal types, and computing a set of properties for a new object type. Notice how we leveraged TypeScript 2.1&amp;rsquo;s new indexed access types here by writing out T[P]. So instead of defining a completely new type like PartialPerson, we can just write Partial&lt;Person&gt;. Originally, we planned to ship a type operator in TypeScript 2.1 named partial which could create an all-optional version of an existing type. Because the Partial and Readonly types we used above are so useful, they&amp;rsquo;ll be included in TypeScript 2.1. Do be careful though - TypeScript will assume the package has the type any, meaning you can do anything with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Html This product is primarily written in JavaScript with node. Js, and opens multiple HTTP RPC ports for handling API requests. It took about 30 seconds to spot one that permits arbitrary command execution, openUrlInDefaultBrowser, which eventually maps to ShellExecute(). This means any website can launch arbitrary commands, like this: x = new XMLHttpRequest() x.open(&amp;ldquo;GET&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;Https://localhost:49155/api/openUrlInDefaultBrowser?url=c:/windows/system32/calc.exe&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;Https://localhost:49155/api/openUrlInDefaultBrowser?url=c:/windows/system32/calc.exe&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, true); try catch ;. This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. If 90 days elapse without a broadly available patch, then the bug report will automatically become visible to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Font Awesome, the most ubiquitous icon font on the web, just succesfully finished a Kickstarter campaign flushing a million dollars towards its creators to revamp the icon set. With a clear signal that Font Awesome isn&amp;rsquo;t going away anytime soon, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the technical integrity of its fonts. A font like Font Awesome has about 100.000 coordinates for all glyphs combined, resulting in a potential savings of 100kB! Long story short: the original unitsPerEm of Font Awesome&amp;rsquo;s fonts is 1792. Running our font through it reduces the font down from 150508 to 141376 bytes, saving another 9kB. Not super much, but since it was all dead weight anyway I say good riddance. If each day 73 million websites serve the Font Awesome WOFF to an average of a thousand visitors who don&amp;rsquo;t have these fonts in the browser&amp;rsquo;s cache, at a 26kB savings on the WOFF, we&amp;rsquo;ve saved. If they&amp;rsquo;re sticking to icon fonts instead of SVG, Font Awesome better make their font files awesome too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-new-in-python-3-6-https-docs-python-org-3-6-whatsnew-3-6-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html&#34;&gt; What’s New In Python 3.6 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explains the new features in Python 3.6, compared to 3.5. Whenever a new class is defined, the new method will be called on all descriptors included in the definition, providing them with a reference to the class being defined and the name given to the descriptor within the class namespace. The new PYTHONMALLOC environment variable allows setting the Python memory allocators and installing debug hooks. The new Collection abstract base class has been added to represent sized iterable container classes. The new DomainFilter filter class has been added to filter block traces by their address space. Since the typing module was provisional in Python 3.5, all changes introduced in Python 3.6 have also been backported to Python 3.5.x. The typing module has a much improved support for generic type aliases.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some talks which have given me new insight into programming, and in particular what good programming is and isn&amp;rsquo;t. Software is the platform Code should be designed around a model of the world Code is more important than data Jonathan Blow: How to program independent games. One of the most important metrics to optimize for is hours of your life spent programming something. Eskil Steenberg: How I program in C. In the beginning all you want is results, in the end, all you want is control. Brian Will: Why OOP is Bad. Almost everything that&amp;rsquo;s interesting in a non-trivial program are &amp;lsquo;cross-cutting&amp;rsquo; concerns. When faced with the reality of real word programs, promises of encapsulation tend to be broken, and object graphs quickly become tangled webs. The emphasis of programming should be on solving problems, and not on the code itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neovim is a refactor of Vim to make it viable for another 30 years of hacking. Neovim very intentionally builds on the long history of Vim community knowledge and user habits. If you find an article about Vim, it likely also applies to Neovim, unless it&amp;rsquo;s about :smile. App is a macOS Neovim GUI available via homebrew for macOS 10.9+. nvim-hs is a host to enable writing Neovim plugins in Haskell. ZyX-I, a prolific committer to Neovim and Vim, agreed to take the role of &amp;ldquo;Lead developer&amp;rdquo;, i.e. the developer who receives the funding. If the project makes you happy, let the pledge continue! API. The Neovim API is one of the defining technical and &amp;ldquo;Soft&amp;rdquo; features of the project. C will be separated into modules, marking a point where Neovim&amp;rsquo;s VimL implementation diverges from Vim&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start exploring C# or decide to expand your knowledge, you should learn these useful language features, which will help you to simplify the code, avoid errors and save a lot of time. The async / await-pattern works by letting the code continue executing even if something is blocking the execution. The above example can be really useful in unit testing but should be avoided in other contexts as instances of classes should be created using a constructor. These features are practically a necessity in many cases, make sure to actually learn when and how to use them. GetValue(); var defaultValue = 23 //result will be 23 if someValue is null var result = someValue ?? defaultValue;. Format(&amp;ldquo;Some data: , some more data:&amp;ldquo;, someVariable, someOtherVariable); //NewWay var someString = $&amp;ldquo;Some data: , some more data:&amp;ldquo;;. So the new nameof-expression might not seem important, but it really has it value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a walkthrough on how I wrote my own simplistic Unix shell in C, in the hopes that it makes other people feel that way too. The code for the shell described here, dubbed lsh, is available on GitHub. University students beware! Many classes have assignments that ask you to write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code. Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates. These steps are so general that they could apply to many programs, but we&amp;rsquo;re going to use them for the basis for our shell. Our shell will be so simple that there won&amp;rsquo;t be any configuration files, and there won&amp;rsquo;t be any shutdown command. Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing with concepts What makes a good concept? Ideally, a concept represents a fundamental concept in some domain, hence the name &amp;ldquo;Concept.&amp;rdquo; A concept has semantics; it means something; it is not just a set of unrelated operations and types. Examples are C/C++ built-in type concepts: arithmetic, integral, and floating STL concepts like iterators and containers Mathematical concepts like monad, group, ring, and field Graph concepts like edges and vertices; graph, DAG, etc. The first step to design a good concept is to consider what is a complete set of properties to match the domain concept, taking into account the semantics of that domain concept. We call such overly simple or incomplete concepts &amp;ldquo;Constraints&amp;rdquo; to distinguish them from the &amp;ldquo;Real concepts.&amp;rdquo; 12/11/2016 Page 12 of 23 Stroustrup D-R-A-F-T Concepts 5.5 Matching types to concepts How can a writer of a new type be sure it matches a concept? That&amp;rsquo;s easy: We simply static assert the desired concept matches. Overload resolution based on concepts is fundamentally simple: If a function matches the requirements of one concept only, call it If a function matches the requirements of no concept, the call is an error If the function matches the requirements of two concepts, see if the requirements of one of those concepts is a subset of the requirements of the other. 8.7 Concepts like classes Based on experience with other languages and experimentation with C++0x concepts, some people are convinced that concepts should be defined like classes. We have worked together on concepts for many years and share some favorite examples that we have used in the design of concepts and to explain concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase immediately resounded in my head, because to me it was a perfect definition of JavaScript, or at least the current state of JavaScript. II. Douglas Crockford published JavaScript: The Good Parts about eight years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a masterpiece to me, with a lot of takeaways: JavaScript is loaded with crap; there&amp;rsquo;s a great functional language somewhere in there, striving to get out; sometimes, a lot of the times, less is more. We can make a better language out of JavaScript by subsetting it. IV. Unlike any other language, JavaScript runs in browsers. V. I always wonder how is it like to learn JavaScript in 2016, for new programmers and for programmers coming from other languages. Can&amp;rsquo;t the browsers manage multiple versions of JavaScript? is it worth their save, especially now that this uneven language has crawled its way to the server and the desktop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 - the Push Collector: The Push Collector is a producer that collects push requests. Stage 2 - the Pusher: The Pusher is a consumer that demands push requests from the Push Collector and pushes the requests to Firebase. The Push Collector never sends a request to a Pusher unless the Pusher asks for one. Since the Pushers put back-pressure on the Push Collector, we now have a potential bottleneck at the Push Collector. In the Push Collector, we specify how many push requests to buffer. If there are way too many messages moving through the system and the buffer fills up then the Push Collector will shed incoming push requests. The bottom graph is the number of push requests buffered by the Push Collector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It introduces support for generic method syntax along with a few popular convenience features. Dart 1.21 introduces syntax allowing type arguments on methods and functions. For more examples, check out the Using Generic Methods article. We&amp;rsquo;ve had generic methods and functions for a while in strong mode. 1.21 introduces support for generic method syntax even without strong mode. Libraries can use this feature and work in both contexts, providing a stepping stone to full generic methods in all Dart code. X is T will not work outside strong mode if T is a method type argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;d established was that there seemed to be a pattern over time and location: Incidents were happening one after another, in the opposite direction of the previous incident. Could it be something that was not in our dataset that caused the incidents? Imaginary lines connecting the incidents looked suspiciously similar to those in a Marey Chart. We then grouped all related pairs of incidents into larger sets using a disjoint-set data structure. Next, we calculated the percentage of the incidents that could be explained by our clustering algorithm. 189, 259, 0.7297297297297297)What it means: Of the 259 emergency braking incidents in our dataset, 189 cases - or 73% of them - could be explained by the &amp;ldquo;Rogue train&amp;rdquo; hypothesis. We coloured the incident chart based on the clustering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a C programmer, you must be familiar with macros. If you don&amp;rsquo;t define macros carefully, they may bite you and drive you crazy. There are many this kind of macros which uses do while(0) in Linux kernels and other popular C libraries. Do while(0) is the only construct in C that lets you define macros that always work the same way, so that a semicolon after your macro always has the same effect, regardless of how the macro is used. It isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to write multistatement macros that do the right thing in all situations. You can&amp;rsquo;t make macros behave like functions-without do/while(0). In conclusion, macros in Linux and other codebases wrap their logic in do/while(0) because it ensures the macro always behaves the same, regardless of how semicolons and curly-brackets are used in the invoking code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point the author makes about integer division is that it can confuse beginners. The reason for it is simple: when one is working with integers, one often has a problem related to integers in the first place. Performance is not even the point; floating-point numbers are much more complex than integers, and above all, they have different semantics. Bashing the increment and decrement operators became quite popular since Swift has taken the side of their omission. In particular, in C, it&amp;rsquo;s not equivalent with the postfix increment operator. With regards to semicolons: you can&amp;rsquo;t just interpret every newline as if it was a semicolon, because newlines become context-sensitive in this way. Treating newlines as statement endings is hard to remember correctly for humans, too, however appealing it might be at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we find out which syscall puts uses? We can either lookthrough the syscall list, or simply install strace to tracesyscalls and write a simple program that uses puts. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how todo something with syscalls, do it with libc and then strace it tosee which syscalls it uses on the target architecture. Oh no! The &amp;ldquo;Write&amp;rdquo; function is part of the standard library!How do we invoke syscalls without having to link the standard lib? Takes the syscall number followed by either pointers or integersas parameters- sets rax to the syscall number- sets rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8 and r9 to the parameters. Syscall numbers are usually named SYS followed by the syscall nameYou can also add the -m32 flags to check values for 32-bit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can go by different names: code review, peer review, programmer quality assurance, and probably a few others. Code review is a skill that takes a lot of time and practice to become proficient, and it takes even longer to master it. At first you&amp;rsquo;re more likely going to be the one having your code reviewed. Working with production code is very different than stuff learned in a classroom. Code reviewers will quickly tell you if your code is hard/impossible to follow. How much thought do you put into naming conventions? Do you use nondescript variable names like a, b, c? That won&amp;rsquo;t fly with code review. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have someone to review your code, find someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is fairly old - 44 years, now! - and comes from a time when there were possibly more architectures than programming languages. Alas, the popularity of C has led to a number of programming languages&amp;rsquo; taking significant cues from its design, and parts of its design are slightly questionable. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed some languages that do or don&amp;rsquo;t take the same approach as C. Plenty of the listed languages have no relation to C, and some even predate it - this is meant as a cross-reference of the landscape, not a genealogy. In languages with C-like header files, most headers include other headers include more headers, so who knows how any particular declaration is actually ending up in your code? Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s the whole include guards thing. I think it&amp;rsquo;s considerably worse in a statically typed language like C, because the whole point is that you can rely on the types. The language explicitly leaves type concerns in my hands. So if you&amp;rsquo;re designing a language, don&amp;rsquo;t just copy C. Don&amp;rsquo;t just copy C++ or Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, developers rate themselves 7.09 / 10. Employing traditional regression analysis to build a model for predicting programming ability would be tricky: does having more experience cause programming skill to improve, or does having strong innate technical skill cause developers to remain in the industry and grow? We can easily confirm that a positive correlation exists between programming activity and experience, with newbie developers rating their skills 5.02 / 10 on average, and extremely experienced developers rating their skills three whole ranks higher at 8.13 / 10. What&amp;rsquo;s also notable is the range of values selected: for developers with less than 1 years of experience, the distribution is almost completely flat between 1-7, showing that they are more honest with the self-assessment of their programming skills. Do freelance / contract developers believe they are better programmers than full-time developers? What about repository commit activity by developers? Are developers who commit more better? One could argue that a developer who commits code often is either vigilant with accounting for functional code changes, or polluting the codebase in an attempt to show productivity. Are developers who use Stack Overflow as a resource better developers who know how to properly use external references in times of crisis, or are they developers who use it as a crutch to compensate for weak coding skills?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruction $89 on the 6502 is a two-byte NOP. Based on adjacent instructions in the opcode matrix, especially LDA #ii, it would have been STA #ii, a store to an immediate value, which makes no sense. On the 65C02, this instruction is changed to BIT #ii, which almost behaves as a two-byte NOP. One hypothesis is that a programmer working on both NES projects and projects for some 65C02-based system forgot that the original 6502 lacked BIT #ii, but because the instruction does so little anyway, the programmer didn&amp;rsquo;t notice any difference. A clockslide is a is a sequence of instructions that wastes a small constant amount of cycles plus one cycle per executed byte, no matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s entered on an odd or even address. With official instructions, one can construct a clockslide from CMP instructions: &amp;hellip; C9 C9 C9 C9 C5 EA:. Disassemble from the start and you get CMP #$C9 CMP #$C9 CMP $00EA. Disassemble one byte in and you get CMP #$C9 CMP #$C5 NOP. A calculated start address into a clockslide can be used with indirect jumps or LDA highbyte PHA LDA lowbyte PHA RTS) to precisely control timing, such as when playing PCM audio or sending video register changes to the PPU in a raster effect. CMP has a side effect of destroying most of the processor status flags, but unofficial instructions that skip one byte can be used to preserve them. As LOIS 16192 mentioned, the official NOP instruction can be inserted at random places in a particular subroutine that isn&amp;rsquo;t an inner loop. It adds even more entropy to use unofficial NOPs, two-byte NOPs, or two-byte NOPs that read the zero page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universe exposes a wide range of environments through a common interface: the agent operates a remote desktop by observing pixels of a screen and producing keyboard and mouse commands. The environment exposes a VNC server and the universe library turns the agent into a VNC client. Universe includes browser-based environments which require AI agents to read, navigate, and use the web just like people - using pixels, keyboard, and mouse. Universe agents must deal with real-world griminess that traditional RL agents are shielded from: agents must run in real-time and account for fluctuating action and observation lag. Pong is one of the easiest Atari games, but it had the potential to be intractable as a Universe task, since the agent has to learn to perform very precise maneuvers at 4x realtime. While solving Universe will require an agent far outside the reach of current techniques, these videos show that many interesting Universe environments can be fruitfully approached with today&amp;rsquo;s algorithms. Each of these agents uses the same code and hyperparameters as the Flash game agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the simplicity of a VPS, backed by the power, reliability, and security of AWS. As your needs grow, you will have the ability to smoothly step outside of the initial boundaries and connect to additional AWS database, messaging, and content distribution services. A Quick TourLet&amp;rsquo;s take a quick tour of Amazon Lightsail! Each page of the Lightsail console includes a Quick Assist tab. Advanced Lightsail - APIs and VPC PeeringBefore I wrap up, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about a few of the more advanced features of Amazon Lightsail - APIs and VPC Peering. CreateInstances - Create one or more Lightsail instances. All of the Lightsail instances within an account run within a &amp;ldquo;Shadow&amp;rdquo; VPC that is not visible in the AWS Management Console. If the code that you are running on your Lightsail instances needs access to other AWS resources, you can set up VPC peering between the shadow VPC and another one in your account, and create the resources therein. You can now connect your Lightsail apps to other AWS resources that are running within a VPC. Pricing and AvailabilityWe are launching Amazon Lightsail today in the US East Region, and plan to expand it to other regions in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are well over 100 operations in CyberChef allowing you to carry simple and complex tasks easily. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression. Digital data comes in all shapes, sizes and formats in the modern world - CyberChef helps to make sense of this data all on one easy-to-use platform. For those comfortable writing code, CyberChef is a quick and efficient way to prototype solutions to a problem which can then be scripted once proven to work. It is expected that CyberChef will be useful for cybersecurity and antivirus companies. It is hoped that by releasing CyberChef through GitHub, contributions can be added which can be rolled out into future versions of the tool. There are around 150 useful operations in CyberChef for anyone working on anything vaguely Internet-related, whether you just want to convert a timestamp to a different format, decompress gzipped data, create a SHA3 hash, or parse an X.509 certificate to find out who issued it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many programmers are aware that C++ templates are Turing-complete, and this was proved in the 2003 paper C++ Templates are Turing Complete. The C++ FQA has a section showing that parsing C++ is undecidable, but many people have misinterpreted the full implications of this. Some people misinterpret this statement to simply mean that fully compiling a C++ program is undecidable, or that showing the program valid is undecidable. This line of thinking presumes that constructing a parse tree is decidable, but only further stages of the compiler such as template instantiation are undecidable. Simply producing a parse tree for a C++ program is undecidable, because producing a parse tree can require arbitrary template instantiation. Struct SomeType ; template &amp;lt;&amp;hellip;&amp;gt; struct TuringMachine ; template &lt;typename T&gt; struct S ; template&amp;lt;&amp;gt; struct S&lt;SomeType&gt; ; int x; int main(). The parse tree itself depends on arbitrary template instantiation, and is therefore the parsing step is undecidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 22nd of November, Marcan of Hackmii.com released the Homebrew Channel as an open source application, removed the anti-emulation hooks, and fixed a few bugs in Dolphin so that it could run properly! Nearly a decade after its inception, the homebrew channel is finally emulated! Admittedly, it has very little use for Dolphin it is extremely cool to have. Some packed Wii homebrew elfs will only run in Dolphin from the homebrew channel currently. One more thing of importance: If you are running Linux and have a Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, or Broadwell CPU, you may be having some weird performance issues with Dolphin. In order to make the highest quality video dumps from within Dolphin, users will want to use the built-in framedump features. There are people who use Dolphin&amp;rsquo;s Android builds, and some very high end devices can handle Dolphin in some situations. While Dolphin will currently invalidate UIDs on new builds, this is not necessary and with the proper infrastructure they will only be invalidated on actual shader generation changes. While it&amp;rsquo;s been rather maligned by users and developers alike, it remains the most complete UI for Dolphin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git diff -submodule=short displays the old commit and new commit from the submodule referenced by your project: git diff -submodule=log is a bit more useful, and displays the summary line from the commit message of any new or removed commits in the updated submodule: Git 2.11 introduces a third option: -submodule=diff. Git stash show 1$ git stash apply 1$ git stash pop 1And so forth. Git LFS reduces your repository size by using a clean filter to squirrel away large file content in the LFS cache, and adds a tiny &amp;ldquo;Pointer&amp;rdquo; file to the Git object store instead. Smudge filters are the opposite of clean filters - hence the name. The Git LFS smudge filter transforms pointer files by replacing them with the corresponding large file, either from your LFS cache or by reading through to your Git LFS store on Bitbucket. As of Git 2.11, smudge and clean filters can be defined as long running processes that are invoked once for the first filtered file, then fed subsequent files that need smudging or cleaning until the parent Git operation exits. Git cat-file -filtersAnother small improvement for users of Git LFS and other filter-based extensions is the new -filters option for the git cat-file command. Png happens to be tracked with Git LFS, and git cat-file skips the Git LFS smudge filter, so rather than getting our image back we just get the contents of the Git LFS pointer file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing can sometimes be a tricky subject no matter what language you&amp;rsquo;re writing in. There&amp;rsquo;s fear unit testing will take time your team doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Your team can&amp;rsquo;t agree on an acceptable level of test coverage or get stuck bike-shedding* People are frustrated by breaking tests when changing code. Unit testing your code takes some extra time upfront, because of course, you need to write extra code - the tests. If tests did not break, and that code went out to production, now everywhere else the code was used is now broken, you&amp;rsquo;ve got 99 problems but lucky you, testing ain&amp;rsquo;t one. This rule can be applied to unit testing in a number of ways, but the most useful I&amp;rsquo;ve found is to first write the code to make the thing work, preferably small functions and then write a test for it. After you&amp;rsquo;ve been going writing tests for a while, you should start to notice more things you change will break existing tests. In my experience, I see no reason good enough not to at least have some unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterating over it with a for loop implicitly creates an iterator, however in the case of Range that iterator is the structure itself. Iter() constructs a slice iterator, and the call to zip implicitly constructs an iterator for the buffer slice as well. Zip and map both wrap their input iterators in a new iterator structure. Sum repeatedly calls next() on its input iterator, pattern matches on the result, and adds up the values until the iterator is exhausted. Iterators also introduce extra control flow: zip will terminate after one of its inner iterators is exhausted, so in principle it has to branch twice on every iteration. The input slices have a fixed size of 12 elements, and despite the use of iterators, the compiler was able to unroll everything here. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve shown a small snippet of code that uses high-level constructs such as closures and iterator combinators, yet the code compiles down to the same instructions that a hand-written C program would compile to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of people have already been killed by faulty software in cars, while hundreds of people have been killed from faulty software during air travel. &amp;ldquo;Uncle&amp;rdquo; Bob MartinYouTube/Expert Talks MobileBut Martin pointed out, &amp;ldquo;The weird thing is, it was software developers who wrote that code. It was us. Some programmers wrote cheating code. Do you think they knew? I think they probably knew.&amp;rdquo; Sourour&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ashamed&amp;rdquo; post went viral on Hacker News and Reddit and it unleashed a long list of confessions from programmers about the unethical and, sometimes, illegal things they&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to do. Programmers then wrote scripts to help the company&amp;rsquo;s salespeople target these people. Now, he says, these same programmers are &amp;ldquo;Working on startups that scoop up massive amounts of people&amp;rsquo;s location data.&amp;rdquo; YouTube/&amp;ldquo;Uncle&amp;rdquo; Bob Martin - &amp;ldquo;The Future of Programming&amp;rdquo;Another programmer was hired to write software for a radio device and was asked to make it use channels reserved for emergency services because this would make the device operate faster. He warned, if programmers don&amp;rsquo;t start to govern themselves, after that apocalypse event that kills thousands of people occurs, legislators will do it for them, dictating everything about their jobs, down to the languages they are allowed to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance penalty of HTTPS is gone HTTPS arguably performs better than HTTP on modern devices. Historically these certificates have been issued by certificate authorities, and they were at least $30 per year per website, sometimes hundreds of dollars per year. Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is a 501.3&amp;copy;(3) non-profit organization supported by the Linux Foundation. As a company, we&amp;rsquo;ve donated a Discourse hosted support community, and a cash amount that represents how much we would have paid in a year to one of the existing for-profit certificate authorities to set up HTTPS for all the Discourse websites we host. Estimate how much you would have paid for any free SSL certificates you obtained from Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, and please donate that amount to Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. If you work for a large company, urge them to sponsor Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt as a fundamental cornerstone of a safe web. If you believe in an unalienable right to privacy on the Internet for every citizen in every nation, please support Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to be releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14971 for PC to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge: The reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files - you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. Bringing 3D to Everyone via the Paint 3D Preview app: Starting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Remix 3D Preview, the community counterpart to Paint 3D Preview, is expanding to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland for Windows Insiders today! Remix 3D Preview is currently only available in English but we will continue to expand our region and language support. For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings &amp;gt; Personalization &amp;gt; Taskbar, and turning &amp;ldquo;Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Off&amp;rdquo;. As we have previously announced we are working on the Windows Holographic Shell that is going to be included in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. We love seeing our Windows Insiders organize #WINsiders4Good events on their own! This is exactly why we created the DIY kit and we love seeing you all use it to build relationships and solve problems in your communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before modeling a pretty car I started with something simpler: a box. I coded up a simple red box and dropped it into the terrain. At one point I changed the color of the box to white, relaunched the game and - there it was! A nice little box sitting in the landscape. Why would the box only be visible when it has a certain color? I checked the pixel shader. Everything seemed OK - but why was my box invisible when it was red? And only when it was red? I could find it when it was blue, white, black and purple. I tried resetting the color to red again and - WTH!? - there it was! I was back where I started code-wise, but now the box was visible again. As it turned out, the reason I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the red box in the green landscape was simple: I am red-green color blind.&lt;/p&gt;

Grace Hopper, Posthumously Receives Presidential Medal of Freedom &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace Murray Hopper, best known for her advancements in computer programming and data processing, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously by President Barack Obama during a White House ceremony Nov. 22. &amp;ldquo;While the women who pioneered software were often overlooked the most prestigious award for young computer scientists now bear her name,&amp;rdquo; he said, referring to the annual Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Computer Professionals, established in 1971 by the Association for Computing Machinery. To accept the award on Hopper&amp;rsquo;s behalf was her grand-niece Deborah Murray, who stood alongside the president as the citation was read, &amp;ldquo;As a child who loved disassembling alarm clocks Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper found her calling early. Known today as the&amp;rdquo;queen of code&amp;rdquo; Grace Hopper&amp;rsquo;s work helped make the coding language more practical and accessible&amp;hellip;Amazing Grace was committed to making the language of computer programming more universal. Today we honor her contributions to computer science and the sense of possibility she inspired for the generations of young people. There, she completed groundbreaking work in computer technology, including producing a model of the electronic computer, the Mark I, and introducing the word &amp;ldquo;Bug&amp;rdquo; to describe a computer malfunction. Often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Mother of computing,&amp;rdquo; Hopper was instrumental in the creation of UNIVAC, the first all-electronic digital computer. Tighe, who has described Hopper as a role model, added, &amp;ldquo;Quite simply, and on many levels, Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper is an inspiration for us all. As a pioneer in computing, as a woman leading the way in the STEM field at a time when that was almost completely unheard of, and as a dedicated naval officer, she paved the way so that all of us who followed could succeed. All of us in the Information Warfare Community owe her our gratitude. The award of the Presidential Medal of Freedom is both well-earned and well deserved!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

You place your input numbers as binary in the inputs, a marble is a one, no marble is a zero. If there is no marble in: no marble outIf there is one marble in: no marble outIf there is two marble in: one marble out. If you have one marble than it passIf you have two marbles then they should cancel out. If there is one marble: make it fall in the first outputIf there is two marbles: make one of them fall in the second output. The first marble flip a little piece of cardboard, so if there is a second marble it fills fall in a hole. If there is one marble: make it fall in the first outputIf there is two marbles: make one of them fall in the second outputIf there is three marbles: make one the fall in the first output and another in the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the bug, we&amp;rsquo;re going to need to understand the hash table strategy used by Rust&amp;rsquo;s standard hash tables. A major challenge in any general-purpose hash table implementation is how to handle hash collisions; If you have a table with N buckets, eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll get two elements with the same value of hashcode%N, and what do you do? In hash tables, &amp;ldquo;Open addressing&amp;rdquo; refers to the technique of, upon encountering a collision, somehow selecting an alternate location in the hash table. The problem occurs because iteration over a hash table procedes by walking the backing array of the hash table directly. They&amp;rsquo;re also speculating about a more fundamental fix to the hash table implementation, so that users who drop in a different hash algorithm are not again vulnerable. One proposal is that hash tables ought to retain their insertion order, since this bug is much less likely to happen if tables do not leak their hash order. Rust&amp;rsquo;s hash tables were very carefully thought by experienced developers well-versed in the literature and practice of deliberate quadratic attacks on hash tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps the prettiest number system of all is the balanced ternary notation&amp;rdquo; - Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. Enter Setun, a balanced ternary computer developed in 1958 by a small team led by Nikolay Brusentsov at the Moscow State University. In its balanced form, we can think of the ternary values as being &amp;ldquo;Balanced&amp;rdquo; around the mid-point of 0. In balanced ternary, as we&amp;rsquo;re about to discover, to represent the inverse of a number we simply have to swap all +&amp;rsquo;s with -&amp;rsquo;s and vice versa. The development of balanced ternary machines has all but faded into a small footnote in the annals of computer history. For the moment at least, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that you&amp;rsquo;ll be hearing much more about balanced ternary computers in the near future. Although Setun was the first electronic device to operate on balanced ternary, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that the idea of using balanced ternary in computing devices was first popularized over 100 years before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only &amp;ldquo;Cannot&amp;rdquo; run Python 2 inside the Python 3 VM because no one has written a Python 2 interpreter in Python 3. Python 3 comes with a tool called 2to3 which is supposed to take Python 2 code and translate it to Python 3 code. So my Python 3 code, written and intended purely for Python 3, now has to deal with Python 2 integers as well. What about the standard library, which has had a number of improvements in Python 3 that don&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t exist in Python 2? Should Python ship two entire separate copies of its standard library? What about modules like logging, which rely on global state? Does Python 2 and Python 3 code need to set up logging separately within the same process? Python 3 has been purposefully crippled to prevent Python 2&amp;rsquo;s execution alongside Python 3 for someone&amp;rsquo;s professional or ideological gain. By the way, did you know that several error messages are much improved in Python 3? Python 2 is somewhat notorious for the confusing errors it produces when an argument is missing from a method call, but Python 3 is specific about the problem, which is much friendlier to beginners. Now we&amp;rsquo;re finally, finally at the point where virtually all libraries support Python 3, a few new ones only support Python 3, and Python 3 adoption is starting to take hold among application developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common mechanism is to call a function that isn&amp;rsquo;t defined and rely on the optimizer to compile-out the function call if your assertion is correct. In sympathy for the need for compile-time assertions, GCC 4.3 introduced the the error function attribute that allows you to extend upon this older concept, but generate a compile-time error with a message of your choosing - no more cryptic &amp;ldquo;Negative sized array&amp;rdquo; error messages! This macro will evaluate its parameter exactly once and create a compile-time error that says &amp;ldquo;I told you not to give me a five!&amp;rdquo; if the expression evaluates to five or is not a compile-time constant. So why aren&amp;rsquo;t we using this instead of negative-sized bit-fields? Alas, there are currently many restrictions of the use of statement expressions, including their use as constant initializers even if the statement expression is completely constant its self test). Hopefully, GCC will amend these shortcomings soon and allow constant statement expressions to be used as constant initializers. The challenge here is the language specification defining what is a legal constant expression. So I hope that gcc can make a constexpr functionality available as an extension via -std=gnuc99 &amp;amp; -std=gnuc11 or some such and allow its use on statement expressions et.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re not quite feature complete, and there are still a couple of rough edges, we know of many people, inside and outside of JetBrains, who are already using Rider for day-to-day development. TL;DR:. Download the first public Rider EAP build. While the plugin SDK is still under development, Rider already supports both IntelliJ and ReSharper plugins, so Rider can take advantage of existing IntelliJ plugins such as VIM editing mode. Check out Hadi&amp;rsquo;s Rider Tips and Tricks video from NDC Sydney for more examples of how the IntelliJ platform will help you using Rider. Remember, Rider is built from the ReSharper codebase - Rider IS ReSharper. So that&amp;rsquo;s what it&amp;rsquo;s going to be - welcome to JetBrains Rider. Download the first public Rider EAP build from the web site, or fire up Toolbox: Rider&amp;rsquo;s going to be there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO NOT, under ANY circumstances, create and/or modify Linux files using Windows apps, tools, scripts, consoles, etc. Creating/changing Linux files from Windows will likely result in data corruption and/or damage your Linux environment requiring you to uninstall &amp;amp; reinstall your distro! If WSL can&amp;rsquo;t find Linux file metadata for a given file, it assumes the file is corrupted/damaged, and will likely fail to open/read the file correctly, causing apps, tools, etc. Several Windows tools implement different strategies to handle file updating and don&amp;rsquo;t actually edit files in-place. To work on files using both Windows and Linux tools, store &amp;amp; work on those files in your Windows filesystem, and access them from both Windows and from Bash via /mnt/&lt;drive&gt;/path. So you can easily access the same files using both Windows tools and Bash tools without having to copy files back and forth between filesystems. DO store files in your Windows filesystem that you want to create/modify using Windows tools AND Linux tools DO NOT create / modify Linux files from Windows apps, tools, scripts or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical renderer, you might have a table of all the materials, a table of all the meshes, a table of all the instances of meshes, a table of all the cameras, and etc. The specifics of these tables depends on your project, so if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a skeletal animation project you would also have a table of the skeletons, instances of skeletons, and so on. Table usually have a &amp;ldquo;Primary key&amp;rdquo;, which can be used to identify each object in the table uniquely, and can also be used to efficiently lookup the object. Each mesh instance would then have a foreign key to the mesh table, and a foreign key to the transform table. I should point out that since my Scene class is implemented only in terms of plain OpenGL objects, that makes it easy for anybody to write an OpenGL renderer that reads the contents of the tables and renders them in whatever way they see fit. You might have a table for all the transforms, a table for mesh instances, and a table for meshes. To support relative transformations, I suggest creating a new table that stores the edges of the transformation tree, meaning each object in the table stores the foreign keys of two transforms: The parent and the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a file in your git repository, prints other files that are most often committed together. &amp;gt; src/core/Object3D.js most often committed with: # together Similarity Name 51 0.22 src/core/Geometry. This means that file Object3D.js is most often committed with Geometry. The Similarity column shows Jaccard index of two files. Usage: git-also [options] &lt;file&gt; For a &lt;file&gt; in your git repository prints other files that are most often committed together Options: -h, -help output usage information -V, -version output the version number -c, -count &lt;n&gt; Print top N other files. Files are often committed together when developers improve code or add new features. What are related file to this file? Where else should I look when I fix bugs in this file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly show where we try to become more confident and excited about programming by learning intriguing things that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know before. Today, we are are going to talk about composition over inheritance. Inheritance is when you design your types after what they are, while composition is when you design your types after what they cando. We are going to learn about the limitations of inheritance, and how to solve them using composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over 2 years ago Microsoft announced that they were open sourcing large parts of the. First we are going to see an overview of the level of activity in each repo, by looking at the total number of &amp;lsquo;Issues&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Pull Requests&amp;rsquo; per month. The main trend I see across all repos is there&amp;rsquo;s a sustained level of activity for the entire 2 years, things didn&amp;rsquo;t start with a bang and then tailed off. This data represents the total participation from the last 2 years, i.e. November 2014 to October 2016. Finally we can see the &amp;lsquo;per-month&amp;rsquo; data from the last 2 years, i.e. November 2014 to October 2016. Whilst not every repo is growing month-by-month, the majority are and those that aren&amp;rsquo;t at least show sustained contributions across 2 years. I think that it&amp;rsquo;s clear to see that the Community has got on-board with the new Open-Source Microsoft, producing a sustained level of contributions over the last 2 years, lets hope it continues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating abstractions, stepping down is as important as stepping up. Here, we take the abstraction from the previous section, and overlay a concrete representation on top of it. Every point on a visual abstraction typically corresponds to a particular concrete state. Pointing at the abstraction to step down to a concrete representation lets us quickly explore regions of interest. In the concrete representation it jumps out at us, because it violates our common sense. That is, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to step down from the abstraction just in our heads. We&amp;rsquo;re not far off the ground yet! As we climb higher on the ladder of abstraction, it will become harder to imagine the concrete steps beneath, and more critical that our abstractions provide a way to interactively step down to a more concrete representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Hamilton wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to invent the modern concept of software and land men on the moon. Hamilton, a 24-year-old with an undergrad degree in mathematics, had gotten a job as a programmer at MIT, and the plan was for her to support her husband through his three-year stint at Harvard Law. As a working mother in the 1960s, Hamilton was unusual; but as a spaceship programmer, Hamilton was positively radical. Hamilton would bring her daughter Lauren by the lab on weekends and evenings. Like female coders in today&amp;rsquo;s diversity-challenged tech industry, Hamilton was an outlier. As Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s career got under way, the software world was on the verge of a giant leap, thanks to the Apollo program launched by John F. Kennedy in 1961. At the MIT Instrumentation Lab where Hamilton worked, she and her colleagues were inventing core ideas in computer programming as they wrote the code for the world&amp;rsquo;s first portable computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;programmers-are-having-a-huge-discussion-about-the-unethical-and-illegal-things-they-ve-been-asked-to-do-http-www-businessinsider-com-programmers-confess-unethical-illegal-tasks-asked-of-them-2016-11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/programmers-confess-unethical-illegal-tasks-asked-of-them-2016-11&#34;&gt; Programmers are having a huge discussion about the unethical and illegal things they’ve been asked to do &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of people have already been killed by faulty software in cars, while hundreds of people have been killed from faulty software during air travel. Martin pointed out, &amp;ldquo;The weird thing is, it was software developers who wrote that code. It was us. Some programmers wrote cheating code. Do you think they knew? I think they probably knew.&amp;rdquo; Sourour&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ashamed&amp;rdquo; post went viral on Hacker News and Reddit and it unleashed a long list of confessions from programmers about the unethical and, sometimes, illegal things they&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to do. Programmers then wrote scripts to help the company&amp;rsquo;s salespeople target these people. Now, he says, these same programmers are &amp;ldquo;Working on startups that scoop up massive amounts of people&amp;rsquo;s location data.&amp;rdquo; Another programmer was hired to write software for a radio device and was asked to make it use channels reserved for emergency services because this would make the device operate faster. He warned, if programmers don&amp;rsquo;t start to govern themselves, after that apocalypse event that kills thousands of people occurs, legislators will do it for them, dictating everything about their jobs, down to the languages they are allowed to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-code-i-m-still-ashamed-of-https-medium-freecodecamp-com-the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e-vmbgbtgin&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e#.vmbgbtgin&#34;&gt; The code I’m still ashamed of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write code for a living, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful - if not outright unethical. In Canada, there are strict limits on how pharmaceutical companies can advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers. As a result, these companies would create websites that present general information about whatever symptoms their drugs were meant to address. In the end, I understood that the real purpose of the site was to push a particular drug. We had discovered while working on the project that she had actually been prescribed the very drug I was building a site for. Still, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt okay about writing that code. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine them recommending prescription drugs soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;microsoft-joins-the-linux-foundation-as-a-platinum-member-http-venturebeat-com-2016-11-16-microsoft-joins-the-linux-foundation-as-a-platinum-member&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/16/microsoft-joins-the-linux-foundation-as-a-platinum-member/&#34;&gt; Microsoft joins The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft announced it is joining The Linux Foundation. Microsoft already contributes to several of its projects, including Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative. &amp;ldquo;Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology,&amp;rdquo; The Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin said in a statement. &amp;ldquo;The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open-source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open-source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company&amp;rsquo;s expanding range of contributions.&amp;rdquo; We interviewed Zemlin, who was excited to elaborate on the news, noting that The Linux Foundation and Microsoft started conversations about membership earlier this year. Microsoft naturally stands to benefit as well, and not just in terms of PR. In addition to Microsoft taking an active role in making the organization better, membership means the company can better collaborate with the open-source community to improve mobile and cloud technology that millions rely on. &amp;ldquo;The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community&amp;rsquo;s most innovative open-source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Rebellion is all about getting your programming abilities to the point of usefulness as quickly as possible. Now, a majority of the time the fate of the planet won&amp;rsquo;t depend on your latest Python project. Have you ever had the experience where you start a course and get through the first few lectures, only to forget about it the next week? Or download an ebook and never get around to opening it? Or get bored of artificial exercises? Or lose interest in a project you know isn&amp;rsquo;t really useful to you or that you don&amp;rsquo;t truly care about? Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve started and never finished. Sounds kind of pathetic, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? But at that point I was starting to get a feel for the language, and I came up with a personal project I was genuinely interested in: writing a program that composed music. It didn&amp;rsquo;t win any Grammy&amp;rsquo;s, but going through the entire process of envisioning an ambitious project, methodically working through it, and ending with an actual working product brought me to a whole new level in programming, more so than any course or ebook ever did. So if you&amp;rsquo;re in the beginning-to-intermediate stages of your programming journey, here&amp;rsquo;s my suggestion to you: find a need or passion of yours that you think might just be possible to address with code and start working on it ASAP. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of projects to jump-start your thinking. If you can&amp;rsquo;t see exactly how to get from point A to point B, good! That means you&amp;rsquo;re going to learn something along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-million-github-profiles-were-leaked-from-geekedin-s-mongodb-https-www-troyhunt-com-8-million-github-profiles-were-leaked-from-geekedins-mongodb-heres-how-to-see-yours&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.troyhunt.com/8-million-github-profiles-were-leaked-from-geekedins-mongodb-heres-how-to-see-yours/&#34;&gt; 8 million GitHub profiles were leaked from GeekedIn&amp;rsquo;s MongoDB &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of any implementation within GitHub that publicly exposed this information for the purpose of mass consumption, and frankly, by now it was starting to smell a bit bad&amp;hellip;. Last thing before I start talking about disclosure: when I analysed the data set I found almost 8.2 million unique email addresses. Moving on, given what I&amp;rsquo;d seen thus far I decided to reach out to GitHub directly as it was their data that was involved here, even if it was leaked from another service. Particularly if data was circulating among traders, there was every chance people would start popping up and saying &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the GitHub data breach&amp;rdquo;. Third parties frequently scrape public GitHub data for various reasons, such as research or archival purposes. It is wrong, not just the scraping of GitHub in the first place in order to commercialise our information, but then subsequently losing it via a MongoDB with no password and now having it float around the web in data breach trading circles. No, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been aggregated en masse and no, it definitely shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been leaked, but it is data that on a per-individual basis you can go and retrieve from anyone&amp;rsquo;s GitHub profile. That&amp;rsquo;s it! Once again, you&amp;rsquo;re only going to show up here if your email address was successfully pulled from GitHub, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful for the million plus people whose data was exposed somewhere they never expected it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s developers often hear about leveraging machine learning algorithms in order to build more intelligent applications, but many don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. One of the most important aspects of developing smart applications is to understand the underlying machine learning models, even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t the person building them. Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuff. Machine learning is about learning to do better in the future based on what was experienced in the past. The two main types of machine learning algorithms are supervised and unsupervised learning. Pandas is a Python library that uses data frames such as R. While it slow to use in production, Pandas is a favorite in using for data analysis and machine learning in a Python environment. Scikit-learn is another favorite Python library and is a great place to find machine learning models with tutorials and documentation that have been vetted by many Python developers.&lt;/p&gt;

As Samsung&amp;rsquo;s Hong-Seok Kim told me, Samsung was looking for a framework in addition to the web framework and C API that Tizen developers currently use to write their applications. &amp;ldquo;We looked into alternatives but.NET was superior,&amp;rdquo; he said and noted that Samsung was looking for a framework with a strong foundation in terms of language support, APIs and tooling, as well as one with a large built-in developer base and open-source community. NET&amp;rsquo;s existing ecosystem, Samsung surely hopes that this move will also broaden its own Tizen developer ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more companies and developers we have, the better and faster the matching we can do with developers and hopefully their dream jobs. I helped build this because I think it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome way we can improve life over resumes and CVs. It helps developers show off who they are, the things they do, and in an approachable way that&amp;rsquo;s maintainable. While we&amp;rsquo;d love to help match you to a perfect company, we built both Jobs and Developer Story to support our core mission of serving ALL developers, including those of you who just don&amp;rsquo;t care about job searching right now. We&amp;rsquo;re working to change how companies treat developers not only through the standards built into Jobs, but also through our Developer Hiring Blog, which we created for the express purpose of improving employer and recruiter practices. With Developer Story, we want to change the perception that developers are only as good as their last gig or a title. We&amp;rsquo;re going to spend more time developing Stack Overflow Enterprise. We are in the process of sending out an email now announcing Developer Story to the larger community in the hopes that we can help some percentage of developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I wanted to send data using your monitor and a webcam, but how could I send data reliably without too much work? QR Code! So the idea this time is to use a tun device, read packets from it, convert to QR Code and display on screen. First, you need some way to acknowledge that the other side read my message, so I added a simple header of the form SEQ/ACK where I increment the sequence with each new qrcode and increment the acknowledge when I successfully read the other sides qr code. QR Codes support a binary mode, but this is the least efficient and decided to instead use alphanumeric and base32 encode the packet data. Base64 would not work because the QR Code in this mode only supports uppercase letters. Next was an issue were the library I used to encode the data, qrtools, would generate a qr code, but the data would not be the same when decoding! So I fixed this by detecting this, then adding some padding to the data and trying again until it works, then strip the padding off on the other side. To maintain my sanity during testing, I was able to run the code in a docker container for the remote side, and instead of using webcam, just pass the qr code image file in a volume mount. Speeeeeeed! Only rewrite qrcode when new data is available pack as much data into a qrcode as possible cleanup code, fix syn/ack to avoid packet dups better detection library? Get a better camera for the laptop? Non-vertical youtube videos 🙂. Related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, on July 11 - a week after the election itself - I started hacking away on some code to compute the election result from the CSV files published on the AEC&amp;rsquo;s website. STV what now?The Australian senate uses a proportional representation system called single transferable vote which allows voters to specify several candidates they&amp;rsquo;d like to vote for in order of least to most evil. If your first choice doesn&amp;rsquo;t get enough votes to be elected, your vote is transferred to your second, and so on, until either you run out of people you can bring yourself to vote for, or all the available spots in the senate are filled. The ballot parsing is the most nuanced, as we have to enforce rules about the number of candidates each voter has to specify, and decide which vote to count if someone has voted both above the line and below the line. Although it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to represent these fractions as floating point numbers, this will result in an inevitable loss of accuracy, which could throw the whole election result off. Interestingly, the result of the 2016 election seems reasonably stable with respect to minor alterations of the algorithm and ballot validation rules. Are voting errors uniformly distributed across political allegiances? If not, could the AEC tweak the validation rules to alter the result? Does rounding favour small or large parties? Would we better off paying the computational price to use an exact algorithm with no rounding at all?Pretty graphs related to either of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous production platform assigned each store to a single shard, in a single index. With limited information available at the time of implementation and without a reasonably defined set of product requirements, the hypothesis was that it would be faster for Elasticsearch to only have to query a single shard rather than broadcasting the query over the entire cluster of up to 60+ shards. Stores with big catalogs could create shards upto 150GB Unbalanced shards, data is not distributed evenly over all shards Massive shards take a significant amount of time to relocate when the index is re-sharded Massive shards cause heap stress resulting in heavy Garbage Collection and stop the world events Routed index causes nodes with big shards to get &amp;ldquo;Hot&amp;rdquo; Often seen during traffic bursts and site crawling Causes poor responses times for other stores on shards on those nodes Causes GC pauses on nodes. Must be scalable to allow faceted search for all stores Should limit shard sizes to &amp;lt;50GB Should limit JVM heap size to around 16GB Must be able to meet and exceed current and historical load from current platform Should stick to Elasticsearch default configurations as much as possible, the fewer tweaks the better. Using shard allocation filtering, we can create multiple indexes and assign their shards to particular nodes, essentially creating small clusters within the overall larger cluster. Having fewer shards increases the performance, seemingly regardless of the number of shards. So now to find the documents for any given store, we only need to query 8 shards so we only have to wait for those 8 shards to be searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, when Microsoft announced plans to release SQL Server for Linux, Scott Guthrie, EVP of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s cloud and enterprise group, said, &amp;ldquo;This will enable SQL Server to deliver a consistent data platform across Windows Server and Linux, as well as on-premises and cloud.&amp;rdquo; The release of the first public preview of SQL Server for Linux on Wednesday reveals just how consistent that platform is: It&amp;rsquo;s the Windows version of SQL Server running on the Windows NT kernel as a guest app, more or less. Microsoft could have ported SQL Server to run as a native Linux application. SQL Server for Linux runs atop a Drawbridge Windows library OS - a user-mode NT kernel - within a secure container called a picoprocess that communicates with the host Linux operating system through the Drawbridge application binary interface. In other words, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s SQL Server for Linux is really the Windows SQL Server executable with a small Windows 8 kernel glued underneath, all running in a normal Linux process. In theory, Microsoft can use this technology to bring its other Windows server applications to Linux with minimal changes, using SQL Server as a starting point. Where once Linux was a cancer to Microsoft, now Windows is growing inside of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with a problem, think &amp;ldquo;I know, I&amp;rsquo;ll use regular expressions.&amp;rdquo; Now they have two problems. I&amp;rsquo;m not completely sure where I stand as to the universal utility of regular expressions, but I did meet with a problem recently with the markdown parser that our team was using on a project. As I needed an immediate fix, I went to the source, soon finding myself amidst regular expressions like the following. Then I remembered having seen a service called regexper.com, a site that helps turn regular expression strings into something like this. Anyway, this was how the regular expression turned out for me. Regular expressions that were once hard to describe using only words, with the help of imaging, are now much easier to express and understand. Satisfied with the results, and since I was on the subject, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d apply &amp;ldquo;Regexper&amp;rdquo; on all the regular expressions that showed up in the &amp;ldquo;Marked&amp;rdquo; module I was working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen many computer programmers proudly proclaim &amp;ldquo;Yup, I designed my code in an object oriented way - I have defined my data members as private, they can be only accessed through public methods - I have created base classes and sub-classes that follow a hierarchy - I have created virtual methods in the base class that shares common behavior that can be used in derived classes.&amp;rdquo; Is that what object orientation is all about? There is definitely more to it. Now the Account class has the flexibility to delegate the logging activity to the Logger class and it can focus only on Account related activities. Can we try extending the code by adding a new class whenever a new account type needs to be added and inherit it from Account class? By doing so, we are not only abstracting the Account class but also allowing it to share common behavior across it&amp;rsquo;s child classes. The OnlineAccount class will only implement IProcessInterest while the Account class will implement both IProcessInterest and IWithdrawable. Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the first issue we resolved where we added Logger class to delegate the responsibility of logging from Account class. We are again violating the Account class by giving more responsibility to decide which instance of the Logging class to be created. It is not the job of Account class to decide on object creation for logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to be releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14971 for PC to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring. Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge: The reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files - you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. Bringing 3D to Everyone via the Paint 3D Preview app: Starting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Remix 3D Preview, the community counterpart to Paint 3D Preview, is expanding to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland for Windows Insiders today! Remix 3D Preview is currently only available in English but we will continue to expand our region and language support. For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings &amp;gt; Personalization &amp;gt; Taskbar, and turning &amp;ldquo;Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Off&amp;rdquo;. As we have previously announced we are working on the Windows Holographic Shell that is going to be included in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. We love seeing our Windows Insiders organize #WINsiders4Good events on their own! This is exactly why we created the DIY kit and we love seeing you all use it to build relationships and solve problems in your communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the Nation&amp;rsquo;s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors. The awards will be presented at the White House on November 22nd. President Obama said, &amp;ldquo;The Presidential Medal of Freedom is not just our nation&amp;rsquo;s highest civilian honor - it&amp;rsquo;s a tribute to the idea that all of us, no matter where we come from, have the opportunity to change this country for the better. From scientists, philanthropists, and public servants to activists, athletes, and artists, these 21 individuals have helped push America forward, inspiring millions of people around the world along the way.&amp;rdquo; He has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role five times, and received the award for his work in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. During his career, he won six championships, five Most Valuable Player awards, and appeared in 14 All-Star games. Diana Ross is an Academy Award nominee, inductee into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame, and recipient of the Grammy Awards highest honor, the Lifetime Achievement Award. She has won two Emmy Awards and a Tony Award, and is known for her performances in Sounder, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, and The Help. In 2013, she returned to the stage with The Trip to the Bountiful, and was awarded the Tony Award for best leading actress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re launching a new annual review process next year that is radically simplified and focuses on our employees&amp;rsquo; strengths, not the absence of weaknesses,&amp;rdquo; Amazon spokeswoman Teal Pennebaker said. The changes, first reported by tech news site GeekWire and set to become effective in 2017, make Amazon the latest tech firm to abandon the dreaded stack-ranking system. On Friday, several &amp;ldquo;Affinity groups&amp;rdquo; within Amazon wrote to Bezos expressing concern about members feeling &amp;ldquo;Undeservingly pulled into the spotlight&amp;rdquo; of racial and gender controversy during the heated campaign. Bezos replied on Sunday saying that diversity is a core Amazon principle. In the case of Amazon, the regime has generated some unrest. At a website dubbed &amp;ldquo;The Former And Current Employees of Amazon,&amp;rdquo; where Amazonians can post anonymous accounts of their complaints with the company, &amp;ldquo;Performance Reviews&amp;rdquo; is one of the most popular categories. Bloomquist, the recruiter, said that phasing out stack ranking could boost Amazon&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness as an employer as others try to encroach on its talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless this has changed in the release version than it seems there is a mistake within pattern matching example where the variable &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; is used outside its if level scope. If the pattern appears in the condition of an if statement, its scope is the condition and controlled statement of the if statement, but not its else clause. If this is correct than the i variable should not be in scope after the if.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps the prettiest number system of all is the balanced ternary notation&amp;rdquo; - Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. Enter Setun, a balanced ternary computer developed in 1958 by a small team led by Nikolay Brusentsov at the Moscow State University. In its balanced form, we can think of the ternary values as being &amp;ldquo;Balanced&amp;rdquo; around the mid-point of 0. In balanced ternary, as we&amp;rsquo;re about to discover, to represent the inverse of a number we simply have to swap all +&amp;rsquo;s with -&amp;rsquo;s and vice versa. The development of balanced ternary machines has all but faded into a small footnote in the annals of computer history. For the moment at least, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that you&amp;rsquo;ll be hearing much more about balanced ternary computers in the near future. Although Setun was the first electronic device to operate on balanced ternary, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that the idea of using balanced ternary in computing devices was first popularized over 100 years before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jāas abstracts away the abstractions created by JavaScript libraries, frameworks, toolchains, compilers, and linters so you can enjoy the benefits of being on the bleeding edge without having to learn about them. You can write JavaScript like it&amp;rsquo;s 1998, and Jāas will turn it into modern type-safe, modular, and maintainable JavaScript that uses the hottest new libraries to accomplish the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common mechanism is to call a function that isn&amp;rsquo;t defined and rely on the optimizer to compile-out the function call if your assertion is correct. In sympathy for the need for compile-time assertions, GCC 4.3 introduced the the error function attribute that allows you to extend upon this older concept, but generate a compile-time error with a message of your choosing - no more cryptic &amp;ldquo;Negative sized array&amp;rdquo; error messages! This macro will evaluate its parameter exactly once and create a compile-time error that says &amp;ldquo;I told you not to give me a five!&amp;rdquo; if the expression evaluates to five or is not a compile-time constant. So why aren&amp;rsquo;t we using this instead of negative-sized bit-fields? Alas, there are currently many restrictions of the use of statement expressions, including their use as constant initializers even if the statement expression is completely constant its self test). Hopefully, GCC will amend these shortcomings soon and allow constant statement expressions to be used as constant initializers. The challenge here is the language specification defining what is a legal constant expression. So I hope that gcc can make a constexpr functionality available as an extension via -std=gnuc99 &amp;amp; -std=gnuc11 or some such and allow its use on statement expressions et.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the Google entry-level instance is significantly cheaper than both AWS entry-level instances. All Google instances have significantly faster network than the equivalent AWS instances, to the point where they&amp;rsquo;re not even playing in the same league. Google is cheaper per CPU. Google CPU instances have half the memory of AWS CPU instances. Google memory instances have 15% less memory than AWS CPU instances. AWS forces you to buy a big instance to get enough SSD space whereas Google allows you to attach a SSD to a small instance. Only a very particular instance can fulfil the requirements, it comes with many cores and 4800 GB of unnecessary local SSD. The AWS bill is $4k higher than the equivalent setup on Google Cloud. We could recreate any instance from AWS on Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO NOT, under ANY circumstances, create and/or modify Linux files using Windows apps, tools, scripts, consoles, etc. Creating/changing Linux files from Windows will likely result in data corruption and/or damage your Linux environment requiring you to uninstall &amp;amp; reinstall your distro! If WSL can&amp;rsquo;t find Linux file metadata for a given file, it assumes the file is corrupted/damaged, and will likely fail to open/read the file correctly, causing apps, tools, etc. Several Windows tools implement different strategies to handle file updating and don&amp;rsquo;t actually edit files in-place. To work on files using both Windows and Linux tools, store &amp;amp; work on those files in your Windows filesystem, and access them from both Windows and from Bash via /mnt/&lt;drive&gt;/path. So you can easily access the same files using both Windows tools and Bash tools without having to copy files back and forth between filesystems. DO store files in your Windows filesystem that you want to create/modify using Windows tools AND Linux tools DO NOT create / modify Linux files from Windows apps, tools, scripts or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical renderer, you might have a table of all the materials, a table of all the meshes, a table of all the instances of meshes, a table of all the cameras, and etc. The specifics of these tables depends on your project, so if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a skeletal animation project you would also have a table of the skeletons, instances of skeletons, and so on. Table usually have a &amp;ldquo;Primary key&amp;rdquo;, which can be used to identify each object in the table uniquely, and can also be used to efficiently lookup the object. Each mesh instance would then have a foreign key to the mesh table, and a foreign key to the transform table. I should point out that since my Scene class is implemented only in terms of plain OpenGL objects, that makes it easy for anybody to write an OpenGL renderer that reads the contents of the tables and renders them in whatever way they see fit. You might have a table for all the transforms, a table for mesh instances, and a table for meshes. To support relative transformations, I suggest creating a new table that stores the edges of the transformation tree, meaning each object in the table stores the foreign keys of two transforms: The parent and the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-guy-named-marc-andreessen-was-convinced-that-netscape-should-embed-a-programming-language-in-html-javascript-gets-written-in-10-days-flat-https-brendaneich-com-2008-04-popularity&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/&#34;&gt; Some guy named Marc Andreessen was convinced that Netscape should embed a programming language in HTML =&amp;gt; Javascript gets written in 10 days flat. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan Eich convinced his pointy-haired boss at Netscape that the Navigator browser should have its own scripting language, and that only a new language would do, a new language designed and implemented in big hurry, and that no existing language should be considered for that role. As I&amp;rsquo;ve often said, and as others at Netscape can confirm, I was recruited to Netscape with the promise of &amp;ldquo;Doing Scheme&amp;rdquo; in the browser. At least client engineering management including Tom Paquin, Michael Toy, and Rick Schell, along with some guy named Marc Andreessen, were convinced that Netscape should embed a programming language, in source form, in HTML. So it was hardly a case of me selling a &amp;ldquo;Pointy-haired boss&amp;rdquo; - more the reverse. Of course, by the time I joined Netscape, and then transferred out of the server group where I had been hired based on short-term requisition scarcity games, the Oak language had been renamed Java, and Netscape was negotiating with Sun to include it in Navigator. The big debate inside Netscape therefore became &amp;ldquo;Why two languages? why not just Java?&amp;rdquo; The answer was that two languages were required to serve the two mostly-disjoint audiences in the programming ziggurat who most deserved dedicated programming languages: the component authors, who wrote in C++ or Java; and the &amp;ldquo;Scripters&amp;rdquo;, amateur or pro, who would write code directly embedded in HTML. Whether any existing language could be used, instead of inventing a new one, was also not something I decided. The diktat from upper engineering management was that the language must &amp;ldquo;Look like Java&amp;rdquo;. From the beginning, Bill grokked the idea of an easy-to-use &amp;ldquo;Scripting language&amp;rdquo; as a companion to Java, analogous to VB&amp;rsquo;s relationship to C++ in Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s platform of the mid-nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-you-think-you-know-c-https-medium-com-okaleniuk-so-you-think-you-know-c-8d4e2cd6f6a6-mc04v71nr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@okaleniuk/so-you-think-you-know-c-8d4e2cd6f6a6#.mc04v71nr&#34;&gt; So you think you know C? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of programmers claim they know C. Well, it has the most famous syntax, it has been there for 44 years, and it&amp;rsquo;s not cluttered with obscure features. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to claim that you know C. You probably learned it in college or on the go, you probably had some experience with it, you probably think that you know it through and through, because there&amp;rsquo;s not much to know. A B C D1 v2 v3 v4 v5 vYes, the right answer for every question in &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;. C itself does not define padding attributes, so the right answer is: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;. So the right answer is: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;. The fourth looks tricky, but it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard in retrospective, since you already know that int size is not directly specified in the standard. So once again &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch from doing coding bootcamp projects to working on Xeneta&amp;rsquo;s full blown SaaS app with 7 other developers forced me up a pretty steep leaning curve, which I feared I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to ascend, as reading source code of similar projects scared the shit out of me. If not, you&amp;rsquo;ll waste too much time banging you head against the wall. Take notesPeople are usually perfectly fine with helping others out, but you should avoid asking the same question multiple times. So whenever you get help, remember to write down the solution to next time you&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation. There are no stupid questions, but if you&amp;rsquo;ve asked the same question before, it&amp;rsquo;s a stupid one the second time you ask. Often times it&amp;rsquo;s just the terminology that&amp;rsquo;s foreign to you. Then use open time slots to learn more about the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are two variations of oceans in Wind Waker, I find this version to be the most memorable. So to recreate this, I&amp;rsquo;ve use some compound sine curves to displace the texture lookup, as seen above on the right. An added benefit of using sine curves for displacement, is that they animate so beautifully by simply throwing time into the equation. Now, simply combine several sine curves to compound them. 6x+8.94 / 4 Here, four sine curves have been used, each with a different scale and offset. To get started, I again used the compound sine curves technique to create the rising and falling of the waves, displacing the y value of the plane&amp;rsquo;s geometry. To replicate movement around the ocean without actually moving the plane, the texture lookup can be offset by a movement vector, making the texture slide across the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Open SourceAbout 13 years ago a friend introduced me to Open Source community. Why share for free the source code of my program, which I spend months developing? What if someone stole it? What if my &amp;ldquo;Competitors&amp;rdquo; use my source code to improve their products? I contributed and I improved an open source library and the open source community helped me to understand and correctly use collaborative tools like &amp;ldquo;Pull Request&amp;rdquo;. So for every open source project I am using, I am observing the source code. Thanks to open source we have access to some big projects like Mozilla Firefox for iOS or Wordpress for iOS. Being curious and observing projects like these will help you to evolve as Software Developer. Creating open source librariesAt some point I created a custom UIAlertView that I was using to my projects and I decided to make it open source. If you are active at Open Source community then you will be able to keep up with the best Software Developers or even better, to collaborate with them on a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-riot-games-manages-docker-containers-in-production-http-engineering-riotgames-com-news-running-online-services-riot-part-ii&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.riotgames.com/news/running-online-services-riot-part-ii&#34;&gt; How Riot Games manages docker containers in production &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to these three questions is that we need a scheduler - a service that operates at the cluster layer and executes our container strategy. The scheduler is a key component in maintaining the cluster, ensuring that containers are running in the right places, and restarting them when they die. We might want to launch a service such as Hextech Crafting, that needs six container instances to handle its load. The scheduler is responsible for finding hosts with enough memory and CPU resources to support these containers and doing whatever operations are needed to get those containers running. If one of those servers ever goes down, the scheduler is also responsible for finding a replacement host for the affected containers. They didn&amp;rsquo;t support container groups which we felt we&amp;rsquo;d need for bundling sidecar containers with many of our services. Admiral is written in Go and is compiled and packaged into a Docker container when run in a production datacenter. Moving forward, we&amp;rsquo;ll be transitioning work off Admiral and focusing on deploying DC/OS - which has become one of the leading open-source applications for scheduling container workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of frontend development, Angular 2 is perhaps one of the hottest topics. We&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce this 100% free course, containing both video and written content, on getting started with Angular 2. This course is perfect for those who have never touched AngularJS or Angular 2. The Angular-CLI method where you run a simply command to get your Angular 2 app up and running. We start dissecting how Angular 2 apps function at their most fundamental level. These are all of the core fundamentals that one must understand before beginning full Angular 2 apps. So if you&amp;rsquo;re ready to learn Angular 2 development today, let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone! Well anyone that can program in C. If you’re familiar with traditional OpenGL (glBegin, glVertex, glEnd) you’ve got a head start. Even if OpenGL is new to you the API is small and easy to learn.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Blender code that calls legacy OpenGL functions must transition to the new API before we can throw the big switch to enable core profile. Even if OpenGL is new to you the API is small and easy to learn. Here&amp;rsquo;s a small example of legacy OpenGL followed by the new API. We&amp;rsquo;ll be drawing a triangle that has one corner with color A and the other two corners color B, the colors blending smoothly across the triangle. The old API might or might not use shaders but the new API always does. In the new API, vertex attribute values can only be set between Begin and End, and affect the current vertex. The new API has no concept of &amp;ldquo;Current color&amp;rdquo;. 8 branch has the new drawing API; all work should happen there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t realize it myself a lot of times, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way in changing my mindset to handle the terminology of programming ideas and make them seem natural. Do you remember the day when you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand anything of programming terminology? Today, many people do not know what a &amp;ldquo;Segmentation fault&amp;rdquo; is or why their program is crashing. Do you remember how you first grasped these basic ideas of programming? Of course, Stack Overflow has a strict policy on repeating questions that have already been answered, and an unwritten, unspoken policy on downvoting really basic questions - which I quickly learned after the fact. Who is aiming to precisely teach &amp;ldquo;How to compress methods and ideas intuitively so that they can be reconstructed and utilized at will&amp;rdquo; for basic programming concepts? For searching and understanding basic programming terminology? If you remember the time that you searched &amp;ldquo;What is the best programming language?&amp;rdquo; on the Internet, you may remember that the best answer that was given was no answer at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Chinese University of Hong Kong researchers presented at Black Hat EU last week a paper called &amp;ldquo;Signing into One Billion Mobile LApp Accounts Effortlessly with OAuth 2.0.&amp;rdquo; The paper describes an attack that takes advantage of poor OAuth 2.0 implementations and puts more than one billion apps in jeopardy. The researchers examined 600 top U.S. and Chinese Android mobile apps that use OAuth 2.0 APIs from Facebook, Google and Sina-which operates Weibo in China-and support SSO for third-party apps. The researchers found that 41.2 percent of the apps they tested were vulnerable to their attack, including popular dating, travel, shopping, hotel booking, finance, chat, music and news apps. The researchers said the apps they tested had been downloaded more than 2.4 billion times in aggregate, meaning that more than one billion are vulnerable. &amp;ldquo;After signing into the victim&amp;rsquo;s vulnerable mobile app account using our exploit, the attacker will have, in many cases, full access to the victim&amp;rsquo;s sensitive and private information which is hosted by the backend server(s) of the vulnerable mobile app,&amp;rdquo; wrote researchers Ronghai Yang, Wing Cheong Lau, and Tianyu Liu. There&amp;rsquo;s a hitch there; the researchers learned that for backwards compatibility, Facebook identifies early adopters of a mobile app using the public user ID if a user has signed into the app via OAuth before May, 2014, they&amp;rsquo;re still exposed to the attack. Further, the researchers recommend identity providers issue private identifiers rather than relying on global identifiers, and identity providers should also ramp up security testing of apps to include SSO via protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first time 2 should match the empty string, and the second time 2. Q2. $E/z matches 15 characters from the end. So the pattern just before the second pattern must match the first 4 or 3 characters in the first pattern, so 2.2|2)2) must match &amp;hellip;2) or &amp;hellip;2. There cannot be a trailing newline because the last character should be ). And the matched text doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain another ) before the rightmost one, so all other characters must be in the 2. The first line makes the whole expression matches exactly 188 characters since everything has a fixed length. The two times of group 1 matches 45*2 characters plus 29 times 2. If quantifier is not allowed, it is impossible because nothing which can only match one string, can match a string longer than itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt the science of advancing machine learning algorithms through research is difficult. Machine learning remains a hard problem when implementing existing algorithms and models to work well for your new application. The difficulty is that machine learning is a fundamentally hard debugging problem. Debugging for machine learning happens in two cases: 1) your algorithm doesn&amp;rsquo;t work or 2) your algorithm doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well enough. Luckily for machine learning algorithms you also have more signals to figure out where things went wrong. The second compounding factor that complicates machine learning debugging is long debugging cycles. Machine learning developers will run multiple experiments because the bottleneck is often the training of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat recently I wanted to have an Iterator impl which forced the returned Item type to be dropped before the next one could be obtained. Yes, this is usually so that the iterator can &amp;ldquo;Generate&amp;rdquo; data as it goes, using some internal storage. I don&amp;rsquo;t think you could do it with the current Iterator trait even if we had ATC. And certainly not backward compatibly. It has some kind of subtle effects on people who want to write generic code over iterators. In particular, they can no longer assume that the data they produce will outlive the iterator. Now, one of the key things that the current iterator design supports is the ability to have one iterator trait supplying &amp;amp;T, &amp;amp;mut T, or T, as you need it, iter mut(), and into iter(. In that case, the above iterator could work, so in a sense this iterator trait is strictly more expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found is that the cloud was not meant to provide the level of IOPS performance we needed to run an agressive system like CephFS. At a small scale, the cloud is cheaper and sufficient for many projects. It&amp;rsquo;s often sold as, &amp;ldquo;If you need to scale and add more machines, you can spawn them because the cloud is &amp;lsquo;infinite&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. The nature of the cloud is time sharing so you still will not get the best performance. From a cost perspective, it is more economical and reliable because of how the culture of the cloud works and the level of performance we need. How we used our dashboard to understand CephFS in the cloud. Recap: What We Learned CephFS gives us more scalability and ostensibly performance but did not work well in the cloud on shared resources, despite tweaking and tuning it to try to make it work. There is a threshold of performance on the cloud and if you need more, you will have to pay a lot more, be punished with latencies, or leave the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce the latest version of Rust, 1.13.0. Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. As always, you can install Rust 1.13.0 from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the detailed release notes for 1.13.0 on GitHub. We enjoyed three Rust conferences, RustConf, RustFest, and Rust Belt Rust, in short succession. Rust has gained a new operator, ?, that makes error handling more pleasant by reducing the visual noise involved. This sort of evolution is one of the great advantages of a powerful macro system: speculative extensions to the language syntax can be prototyped and iterated on without modifying the language itself, and in return, macros that turn out to be especially useful can indicate missing language features. This is a good example of the kinds of incremental, quality-of-life improvements Rust will continue to receive, polishing off the rough corners of our already-powerful base language.&lt;/p&gt;

The new APIs turned out to be less important than we originally thought but we&amp;rsquo;re nonetheless happy to report Atom users in all locales now get typical keyboard behavior in Atom&amp;rsquo;s default installation. The scope specificity rules for keybindings were understandably confusing lots of Atom users. A new version of the Octicons is now bundled in Atom with improvements to line-weight and sizing normalization. Keystroke Resolver API. To help address the long tail of unusual international keyboard behaviors as interpreted by Chrome, particularly on Linux, Atom 1.13 includes a custom keystroke resolver API allowing users to assign Chrome keyboard events to Atom-style keystrokes. Get all these improvements today by joining the Atom Beta Channel! Join Us! Don&amp;rsquo;t see what you were hoping for here? Join the Atom team at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To serve as a quick guide for JavaScript developers who want to get up to speed quickly with Python, but without having to learn what declaring a variable means or what a function is. Unlike JavaScript, variables in Python are always block scoped. Python is a bit more strict than JavaScript when it comes to syntax. Lists in Python are similar to arrays in JavaScript. Strings in Python are a lot like strings in JavaScript. A module in Python is simply a file that contains some Python code. Python has support for object oriented programming with classes and classical inheritance, unlike JavaScript which has prototypes with prototypal inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. User wants to do X. User doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y. User doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do Y either. User asks for help with Y. Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve. After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a suitable solution for X. The problem occurs when people get stuck on what they believe is the solution and are unable step back and explain the issue in full. N00b doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually want the last 3 chracters in a filename, he wants the file extensions, so why ask for the last 3 characters? &lt;n00b&gt; How can I echo the last three characters in a filename?&lt;feline&gt; If they&amp;rsquo;re in a variable: echo $ &lt;feline&gt; Why 3 characters? What do you REALLY want?&lt;feline&gt; Do you want the extension?&lt;n00b&gt; Yes.&lt;feline&gt; Then ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT!&lt;feline&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that every filename will have a three-letter extension,&lt;feline&gt; so blindly grabbing three characters does not solve the problem. Can iptables do this work?Obama: Well, don&amp;rsquo;t use OS detection or version scanningAngela: I want to prevent others from knowing the type of my OS..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;zeroing-out-my-memory-does-cause-them-to-page-in-faster-after-all-https-blogs-msdn-microsoft-com-oldnewthing-20161109-00-p-94675&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161109-00/?p=94675&#34;&gt; Zeroing out my memory does cause them to page in faster after all &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I answered the question &amp;ldquo;If I zero out my memory pages, does that make them page in faster?&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;. Turns out that I was working from outdated information. My former colleague Adrian Oney confirms the information in the white paper shared by commenter John Doe, namely that starting in Windows Vista, the memory manager does check whether a page that is about to paged out consists entirely of zeroes. Then the memory manager turns the page into a demand-zero page rather than a page stored in the pagefile. Adrian said that he wrote the original prototype which confirmed that the extra check was worth it. &amp;ldquo;Some of this was due to apps dirtying their zero-init pages with inits to zero. Some of it was due to user mode zeroing pages for security reasons. But it was common enough to make it worthwhile.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that the increasing use of virtualization may contribute to this virtuous cycle as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is directly proportional to the CPU load. If computing demand is high, the CPU runs at maximum frequency. If the CPU runs at a low frequency, the user application may not be able to produce the new buffer within time and then users experience &amp;ldquo;Audio dropouts&amp;rdquo;. This is a excruciating problem for developers of Android apps with pro audio requirements, where CPU scaling is quite aggressive. It&amp;rsquo;s highly audible when the audio application goes into the background and Android throttles the CPU back even more, thinking that the application doesn&amp;rsquo;t need the same amount of CPU for audio, when it was in the foreground. In case you were wondering, iOS also faces this problem too, but thanks to it&amp;rsquo;s better scheduling than Android, audio dropouts are only audible when the audio app computes the next audio chunk in more than 50% of the time represented by the buffer. This class implements a &amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo; sustained performance mode, where the CPU runs near the maximum frequency on all CPU cores. Every example project has been updated to use SuperpoweredCPU&amp;rsquo;s sustained performance mode, which provides a for CPU frequency scalcing for every Android device on every Android version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re getting to the juicy bits! Ha puns! If you took an information theory class, you might remember information entropy. Information entropy is the number of bits required to represent some information. The fine grill on that MacBook pro has a high information content in the higher frequency components of that image. Because now, you can take that frequency domain image and then mask out the edges - discard information which will contain the information with high frequency components. The numbers represent the information entropy of that image as a fraction of the original. So there must be some way to discard color information to shed even more weight. Our frames now tiny - since we discarded most of the detail information and half of the color information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pornhub-bypasses-ad-blockers-with-websockets-http-blog-bugreplay-com-post-152579164219-pornhubdodgesadblockersusingwebsockets-utm-source-reddit-programming-utm-medium-post&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.bugreplay.com/post/152579164219/pornhubdodgesadblockersusingwebsockets?utm_source=reddit-programming&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&#34;&gt; Pornhub Bypasses Ad Blockers With WebSockets &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If WebSocket data was not visible to Chrome extensions via the webRequest API, they could not be blocked without some heavy duty hacks. Then in August 2016, an employee of the company that owns Pornhub.com started arguing against adding the WebSocket blocking capabilities to the Chrome API. Pornhub is the 63rd most visited site on the Internet according to Alexa. Watching the BugReplay browser recording, you can see a number of network requests triggered that are blocked by AdBlock: They are marked Failed in the network traffic, and if you click one to inspect the detail pane you can see the failed reason is net::ERR BLOCKED BY CLIENT. That is the error reported by Chrome when an asset is blocked from loading. The name of the domain where the WebSocket connects is &amp;ldquo;Ws://ws.adspayformy.site.&amp;rdquo; A decent joke aimed at ad blockers :). When the WebSocket loads, the browser sends a frame with a JSON encoded payload for each of the spots it has available for ads. Ad Blockers primarily work using the webRequest API, so constructing the ad by transmitting the data over the WebSocket as base64 is a pretty clever way of dodging the blocker. A contributor wrote a patch adding the ability to block WebSockets using the webRequest api. For AdBlock Plus, &amp;ldquo;The wrapper performs a dummy web request before WebSocket messages are sent/received. The extension recognizes these dummy web requests as representing a WebSocket message. It intercepts and blocks them if the corresponding WebSocket message should be blocked. The WebSocket wrapper then allows / blocks the WebSocket message based on whether the dummy web request was blocked or not.&amp;rdquo; via.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear of stories of many software engineers who always knew they were going to work with computers because they started tinkering with them when they were kids. All these are very common for software engineers in the US &amp;amp; Europe but for many of us in Africa? We didn&amp;rsquo;t see a computer until we were halfway through high school. That&amp;rsquo;s how I started learning how to code seriously. Now how do I make students register online for their courses? I can&amp;rsquo;t build another windows application and expect them to download it. That&amp;rsquo;s what led to learning about web development using ASP.net. I didn&amp;rsquo;t become a software engineer because I enjoyed coding or grew up around computers or any of that. I became a software engineer because the problems I cared about solving required me to learn how to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;utf8-everywhere-now-please-http-utf8everywhere-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://utf8everywhere.org/&#34;&gt; UTF8. Everywhere. Now, please. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code point will be encoded as four code units &amp;lsquo;f0 b2 90 bf&amp;rsquo; in UTF-8, two code units &amp;lsquo;d889 dc3f&amp;rsquo; in UTF-16 and as a single code unit &amp;lsquo;0003243f&amp;rsquo; in UTF-32. For some abstract characters, there exist representations using multiple code points, in addition to the single coded character form. The abstract character  can be coded by the single code point U+01F5 latin small letter g with acute, or by the sequence &lt;U+0067 latin small letter g, U+0301 combining acute accent&gt;. A programmer might count characters as code units, code points, or grapheme clusters, according to the level of the programmer&amp;rsquo;s Unicode expertise. Working with a variable length encoding, where ASCII-inherited code points are shorter than other code points may seem like a difficult task, because encoded character boundaries within the string are not immediately known. Even in the Unicode formalism some code points correspond to coded character and some to non-characters. Counting coded characters or code points is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudo-touchid is a fork of sudo with Touch ID support on macOS. Once compiled, it will allow you to authenticate sudo commands with Touch ID in the Terminal on supported Macs. Sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set. Sudo chown root:wheel sudo &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo chmod 4755 sudo. Sudo -s. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Mac with a biometric sensor, sudo-touchid will fall back to the regular password prompt. Replacing the system&amp;rsquo;s sudo program is quite risky and requires disabling System Integrity Protection. Sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/sudo &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/sudo. Now you should be able to enter sudo in any Terminal window and authenticate with Touch ID!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for async/await has been added in the Nightly build from the 31st of October. Time to start removing those JavaScript transpilers from your experimental projects, and testing native browser support 😉. Here&amp;rsquo;s a demo. If your browser supports async/await natively, you will see &amp;ldquo;YES&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like your source code formatted each time you save? VS Code now supports &amp;ldquo;Format On Save&amp;rdquo; which will automatically pick up relevant installed formatter extensions and format the whole document on each save. Since we made VS Code available, we&amp;rsquo;ve had the debt item that some languages were implemented inside VS Code directly and they were not implemented as an extension. As you can see from the recommendations setting above, we recommend that anybody working on the VS Code codebase use the TSLint and ESLint extensions. VS Code prompts a user to install the recommended extensions when a workspace is opened for the first time. Another use case is to create a set of extensions for a particular scenario like PHP development to help a PHP developer get started with VS Code quickly. The Yeoman generator for VS Code extensions has been updated to use TypeScript version 2.0.x. If you start a new VS Code extension, simply install yeoman and the extension generator using npm install -g yo generator-code and run it using yo code. An extension would be able to configure a linter from a warning via a code action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce, in tandem with Firefox and Edge, a WebAssembly Browser Preview. WebAssembly or wasm is a new runtime and compilation target for the web, designed by collaborators from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple, and the W3C WebAssembly Community Group. The binary format and JS API documents outline the binary encoding of WebAssembly and the mechanism to instantiate WebAssembly modules in the browser, respectively. V8 continues to optimize the implementation of WebAssembly in the TurboFan compiler. Js to WebAssembly under the hood so that existing asm. Js sites can reap some of the benefits of WebAssembly ahead-of-time compilation. Barring major design changes arising from community feedback, the WebAssembly Community Group plans to produce an official specification in Q1 2017, at which point browsers will be encouraged to ship WebAssembly on-by-default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A step by step guide that will show you how to contribute to an open source project on GitHub, one of the most popular and used git repository hosting services. The way people contribute to an open source project on GitHub is using pull requests. If you decided to contribute to an open source project on GitHub it&amp;rsquo;s probably because you&amp;rsquo;ve been using that project and you found a bug or had an idea for a new feature. When deciding to contribute to an open source project make sure to check it&amp;rsquo;s still active otherwise your work might remain a pull request forever. Once you are on the main page of the project you want to contribute to look for notes and files that explain how the mantainers expect you contribute to the project. To fork a project on GitHub simply click the Fork button on the top-right corner of a project page. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial explaining how to contribute to an open source project on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to announce that Minoca OS has gone open source. We are releasing the entirety of the Minoca OS source code under the GNU GPLv3. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to build a community of users and developers around this new operating system, and we need help. What is Minoca OS?Minoca OS is a general purpose operating system written completely from the ground up. Under the hood, Minoca contains a powerful driver model between device drivers and the kernel. We took a look at the operating systems out there, and realized it had been over 25 years since the major operating systems had been written. We wanted to see if with 25 years of hindsight and a clean slate we could create something interesting and unique in the operating systems space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vigil is a very safe programming language, and an entry in the January 2013 PLT Games competition. Many programming languages claim to take testing, contracts and safety seriously, but only Vigil is truly vigilant about not allowing code that fails to pass programmatic specifications. Vigil is very similar to Python with the minor proviso that you must provide a main() function which will be automatically called for you. If a function fails to uphold what it has sworn to do, it is wrong and must be punished. When a Vigil program is executed, Vigil itself will monitor all oaths that have been made. If an oath is broken, the offending function will be duly punished. Run Vigil again and it will take care of that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech», is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. LaTeX is just a text document, readily converted to PDF. LaTeX separates content and style. LaTeX offers a lot of functions by default, but in some situations it can come in handy to use so called packages. To add an image to the LaTeX file , you need to use figure environment and the graphicx package. Insert code into LaTeX  First method ✅. One aspect of text compiling that is of the utmost importance to programmers and developers is how to professionally insert codes into the document. LaTeX supports syntax for these languages 💬. As you can see, with the wrapper you can easily insert code without worrying about how the syntax is formatted. Multiple files in LaTeX. When we use LaTeX, we may face a problem that a document is too long to be handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t start caching 404s for every package, and don&amp;rsquo;t plan to, because that creates annoying race conditions for fresh publishes, which is why most CDNs don&amp;rsquo;t cache 404s in the first place. There are any number of ways to fix this, and we&amp;rsquo;ll work with Microsoft to find the best one, but fundamentally you just need a more network-efficient way of finding out which type declarations exist. Might I suggest having a bloom filter containing all the existing type declaration and only querying the registry if the bloom filter reports the type declaration as a positive. Since the filter can be really small it will probably scale a lot better than a complete list of all type-declarations, and a new filter could be downloaded by the clients every now and then. Depends on the bloom filter, but for the fixed size, fixed hash functions, and other implementations in the same general vein, it would just be XOR of both of the bloom filters. Slightly different for counting filters, where something along the lines of subtraction would get you what you need. Can you speak to why it is so expensive on the NPM side to serve a 404? Would a bloom filter like another commenter mentioned be helpful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will take issue with the use of strong words like &amp;ldquo;Stolen code,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Theft,&amp;rdquo; with respect to a GPL violation. Many developers seem to prefer remaining willfully oblivious to the consequences of using GPL code. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s OK for us to use GPL code anywhere, as long as we contribute back changes.&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s only a small amount of GPL code, so the license doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply. The price of GPL is fairly obvious and easy to understand, even if there is some bickering about what constitutes &amp;ldquo;linked code. &amp;rdquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a legal expert to get the gist of it: if you want to link your software with GPL code, you must also make your software&amp;rsquo;s source code available. So what am I supposed to do? Not use any GPL source code at all in any of my proprietary products? Exactly. Because the price of GPL is too much for me, and I don&amp;rsquo;t steal source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s just C. Dennis was also half of the team that created Unix, which in some form or other runs all the machines at Google&amp;rsquo;s data centers and probably at most other server farms. Most web servers run above Unix kernels; most non-Microsoft web browsers run above Unix kernels in some form, even in many phones. In the late 1970s, Dennis joined with Steve Johnson to port Unix to the Interdata. Unix, in the unusual position of being written in a &amp;ldquo;High-level language,&amp;rdquo; could be made to run on a machine other than the PDP-11. The hardware didn&amp;rsquo;t matter any more, since it all ran Unix. Cheap hardware meant cheap Unix installations; we all won. If Unix hadn&amp;rsquo;t been ported to the Interdata, the Internet, if it even existed, would be a very different place today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each CU can be recursively splitted in Transform Units with the same quad-tree approach used in CTBs. Differently from AVC that used mainly a 4×4 transform and occasionally an 8×8 transform, HEVC has several transform sizes: 32×32, 16×16, 8×8 and 4×4. The adaptive nature of CBT, CU and TU partitions plus the higher accuracy plus the larger transform size are among the most important features of HEVC and the reason of the performance improvement compared to AVC. HEVC implements a sofisticated scan order and coefficient signaling scheme that improves signaling efficiency. HEVC drops also the support for MBAFF or similar techniques to code interlaced video. The merge mode is similar, the main difference is that the candidates list is calculated from neighboring MV and is not added to a delta MV. It is the equivalent of &amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;rdquo; mode in AVC. Similarly to AVC, HEVC specifies motion vectors in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pel, but uses an 8-tap filter for luma and a 4-tap &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-pel filter for chroma. CABAC in HEVC is almost identical to CABAC in AVC with minor changes and simplifications to allow a parallel decoding. Since HEVC decoding is much more complex than AVC, several technique to allow a parallal decoding have been implemented. The adaptive subdivision of picture in prediction areas, the use of advanced intra-prediction, inter-prediction and bigger transform sizes can absolutely guarantee, in the long term, a considerably higher efficiency of HEVC compared to AVC. But the complexity of the encoding is really much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forth, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only person frustrated by the lack of people doing interesting things with the language. Elizabeth Rather, co-founder of Forth, Inc., offered the following explanation: there are people solving real problems with Forth, but they don&amp;rsquo;t hang-out in the newsgroup. There were a number of game developers with public faces in the 1990s, but the key people responsible for the original version of The Need for Speed, released in 1994, remained unknown and behind the scenes. Yes, there are many people who blog and otherwise publicly discuss development methodologies and what they&amp;rsquo;re working on, but there are even more people who don&amp;rsquo;t. Other people are working on commercial products and can&amp;rsquo;t divulge the inner workings of their code. All we&amp;rsquo;re seeing is an intersection of the people working on interesting things and who like to write about it-and that&amp;rsquo;s not the whole story. Your time may better spent getting in there and trying things rather than reading about what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala 2.12.0 is the result of merging over 500 pull requests out of about 600 received PRs. The contributions to 2.12.x over the last 2 years were split as 64/32/4 between the Scala team at Lightbend, the community and EPFL. The new encodings of traits, lambdas and lazy vals were developed in fruitful collaboration with the Dotty team at EPFL. Binary compatibility. Since Scala 2.10, minor releases of Scala are binary compatible with each other. Scala 2.12 standardizes on the &amp;ldquo;GenBCode&amp;rdquo; back end, which emits code more quickly because it directly generates bytecode from Scala compiler trees, while the previous back end used an intermediate representation called &amp;ldquo;ICode&amp;rdquo;. The Scala distribution is built using -opt:l:classpath, which improves the performance of the Scala compiler by roughly 5% compared to a non-optimized build. The Java 8 compatibility module for Scala has received an overhaul for Scala 2.12. Even though interoperability of Java 8 SAMs and Scala functions is now baked into the language, this module provides additional convenience for working with Java 8 SAMs. Java 8 streams support was also added during the development cycle of Scala 2.12. Releases are available for both Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why hardware development is hard, part 1: Verilog is weird Why hardware development is hard, part 1: Verilog is weird. How is it possible that a reasonable description of something in Verilog turns into something completely wrong in hardware? You can think of hardware as some state, with pure functions connecting the state elements. To write Verilog that will produce correct hardware, you have to first picture the hardware you want to produce. We hardware folks are so used to the vast majority of legal Verilog constructs producing unsynthesizable garbage that we don&amp;rsquo;t find it the least bit surprising that you not only do you not get compile-time errors, you don&amp;rsquo;t even get run-time errors, from writing naive Verilog code. With hardware, we train up a new generation of people who think that Verilog is as productive as any language could be every few years! I won&amp;rsquo;t even get into how Verilog is so inexpressive that many companies use an ad hoc tool to embed a scripting language in Verilog or generate Verilog from a scripting language. It&amp;rsquo;s not as high level, but it&amp;rsquo;s the only hardware description language with a modern type system that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to discuss with hardware folks without people objecting that Haskell is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applying-the-linus-tarvolds-good-taste-coding-requirement-https-medium-com-bartobri-applying-the-linus-tarvolds-good-taste-coding-requirement-99749f37684a-h5uuz43ge&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@bartobri/applying-the-linus-tarvolds-good-taste-coding-requirement-99749f37684a#.h5uuz43ge&#34;&gt; Applying the Linus Tarvolds &amp;ldquo;Good Taste&amp;rdquo; Coding Requirement &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the best of my ability to discern, the crux of the &amp;ldquo;Good taste&amp;rdquo; requirement is the elimination of edge cases, which tend to reveal themselves as conditional statements. Below is an algorithm I wrote to initialize the points along the edge of a grid, which is represented as a multidimensional array: grid[rows][cols]. Again, the purpose of this code was to only initialize the values of the points that reside on the edge of the grid - so only the top row, bottom row, left column, and right column. To accomplish this I initially looped over every point in the grid and used conditionals to test for the edges. Complexity - The use 4 conditional statements inside 2 embedded loops seems overly complex. It was only a slight improvement in complexity, but a large improvement in performance, because it only performed 256 loop iterations, one for each point along the edge. For This code initializes four different edge points for each loop iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-official-java-9-will-support-ahead-of-time-compilation-but-only-64-bit-linux-initially-http-openjdk-java-net-jeps-295&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/295&#34;&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s official: Java 9 will support ahead-of-time compilation (but only 64-bit Linux initially) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOT compilation of any other JDK module, or of user code, is experimental. During AOT compilation a fingerprint for each class is generated and stored in the data section of the shared library. In these cases, AOT compilation needs be done on the entire application and is thus experimental in JDK 9. The system should have installed libelf to allow generation of AOT shared libraries as result of AOT compilation. AOT compilation should be executed on the same system or a system with the same configuration on which AOT code will be used by Java application. For the initial release in JDK 9 the only supported module for AOT compilation will be java. The same Java run-time configuration should be used during AOT compilation and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to exploit, making it one of the worst privilege-elevation flaws ever to hit the open-source OS. Independent security researcher David Manouchehri told Ars that this proof-of-concept code that exploits Dirty Cow on Android gets devices close to root. With a few additional lines, Manouchehri&amp;rsquo;s code provides persistent root access on all five of the Android devices he has tested. &amp;ldquo;From what I can tell, in theory it should be able to root every device since Android 1.0. Android 1.0 started on [Linux] kernel [version] 2.6.25, and this exploit has been around since 2.6.22.&amp;ldquo;. Both of the exploits allow end users to root Android phones so they have capabilities such as tethering that are often restricted by individual manufacturers or carriers. Just as Dirty Cow has allowed untrusted users or attackers with only limited access to a Linux server to dramatically elevate their control, the flaw can allow shady app developers to evade Android defenses that cordon off apps from other apps and from core OS functions. The reliability of Dirty Cow exploits and the ubiquity of the underlying flaw makes it an ideal malicious root trigger, especially against newer devices running the most recent versions of Android. Dirty Cow came to light a few days before the release of a separate rooting method for Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. For my own stuff, there&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;d use any of that crap. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive. It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range and Precision - What about numbers with a huge amount of digits? According to RFC 7159, &amp;ldquo;A JSON parser MUST accept all texts that conform to the JSON grammar&amp;rdquo;. A JSON parser MUST accept all texts that conform to the JSON grammar. Independently from how parsers should behave, I wanted to observe how they actually behave, so I picked several JSON parsers and set up things so that I could feed them with my test files. The parsers are generally wrapped so that the process returns 0 in case of success, 1 in case of parsing error, yet another status in case of crash, a 5-second delay being considered as a timeout. Parsing should have succeeded but failedparsing should have failed but succeededresult undefined, parsing succeededresult undefined, parsing failedCrashTimeout. A JSON parser transforms a JSON text into another representation. I wrote yet another JSON parser which will parse or reject JSON document according to my understanding of RFC 7159.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extremely unmaintainable and bug-ridden technique for C programming involves using both switch statements and statement expressions together. In this article, we will discuss how you can leverage switch statements and statement expressions to produce C code that is so difficult to understand, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to look at the assembly to figure out what it does. After branching to that label nothing special happens related to the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re inside a switch statement and the code will just keep executing whatever machine instructions come next. The one exception is, of course, the break statement which will jump to the point after the switch statement body. Here is an equivalent version of the switch statement written above using only ifs and gotos. The switch statement effectively just gives us a convenient way to implement the goto statements that would be necessary to either jump to the start of the coroutine, or the point just after the coroutine returns. Regular ole expression &lt;em&gt;/ int i = 0; /&lt;/em&gt; Fancy new statement expression */ int j =;. You might ask &amp;ldquo;Why would you ever want to do such a thing?&amp;rdquo; There are a number of different answers and many of them are related to convenience: One use case is concerned with ensuring that expression statement side-effects are only evaluated once in the case of a function macro that may cause the expression to appear multiple times in the function macro body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;patent-judge-issues-opinion-declaring-all-software-patents-bad-https-www-techdirt-com-articles-20161005-15280135720-prominent-pro-patent-judge-issues-opinion-declaring-all-software-patents-bad-shtml&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161005/15280135720/prominent-pro-patent-judge-issues-opinion-declaring-all-software-patents-bad.shtml&#34;&gt; Patent Judge Issues Opinion Declaring All Software Patents Bad &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest ruling, from the very court that upended things nearly two decades ago in declaring software much more broadly patentable than anyone believed, may now be the nail in the coffin on software patents in the US. The headline, of course, is that the patents that Intellectual Ventures used against anti-virus firms Symantec and Trend Micro, were bunk, because they did not cover patent eligible subject matter. The part that has everyone chattering is the concurring opinion by Judge Haldane Mayer, that says it&amp;rsquo;s time to face facts: Alice killed software patents. In Support of Respondents, Alice, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2014 WL 828047, at *6-7; Mark A. Lemley, Software Patents and the Return of Functional Claiming, 2013 Wis. L. Rev. 905, 935 (&amp;ldquo;Software patents &amp;hellip; have created a large number of problems for the industry, particularly for the most innovative and productive companies&amp;hellip;. [T]he existence of a vibrant open source community suggests that innovation can flourish in software absent patent protection.&amp;rdquo; (footnote omitted ; Wendy Seltzer, Software Patents and/or Software Development, 78 Brook. Mayer goes even further in this discussing four separate problems with the whole concept of software patents, including the fact that the scope of the patents greatly exceeds the importance of what they disclose. The third problem he discusses is the fact that the system is overwhelmed with software patents, &amp;ldquo;Most of which are replete with broad, functional claims&amp;rdquo; which makes it &amp;ldquo;Virtually impossible to innovate in any technological field without being ensnared by the patent thicket.&amp;rdquo; Nicely put. From there, he suggests that the courts should just stop punting on the issue and declare software patents dead: Declaring that software implemented on a generic computer falls outside of section 101 would provide muchneeded clarity and consistency in our approach to patent eligibility. It would end the semantic gymnastics of trying to bootstrap software into the patent system by alleging it offers a &amp;ldquo;Specific method of filtering Internet content,&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;. The opinion is a great read overall - and it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of arguments that plenty of folks in and around tech and software patents have been making for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error message tells us that the list is assumed to be a list of booleans because of the final value. If the list has more than one element, we remove the first element of the list and recursively call last&amp;rsquo; on the rest of the list. The length of a list with more than 0 elements is 1 plus the length of the rest of the list. Map&amp;rsquo; f [] = []. The base case is easy: When we get an empty list passed, the result is also an empty list. Finally we recurse with the rest of the list, until we reach the base case for the empty list. While working with lists in Haskell you might wonder what happens if we never reach the base case? We have lazy evaluation in Haskell, which tells us that a data structure is only evaluated when it&amp;rsquo;s actually needed. The second parameter is a list of values of type a, the third parameter is a list of values of type b and finally a list of type c is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ranking on Hacker Rank is #1 for Java programming and it only took me two hours. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. in December for its two-year technology training program. Much of the time I spent trying to solve problems on Hacker Rank was battling with standard in, rather than solving problems. Due to these limitations, the programmer is often spending half the time fighting with the Hacker Rank website, rather than learning. First of all, Hacker Rank only &amp;ldquo;Teaches&amp;rdquo; the basic Java language features. A programmer&amp;rsquo;s merit has never relied on rankings, and there is no reason to start now. If a person is claiming to be a top ranked programmer from Hacker Rank you should know this person is likely a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been five years since The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim launched, and since then the way open-world games are made has changed so much. Bethesda Softworks has gone on to release Fallout 4, and companies like Ubisoft and CD Projekt Red have built their own templates for creating vast, open game spaces that rival the size of Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s fifth Elder Scrolls RPG. But despite how far open-world games have come, we at Gamasutra were curious, what was it like working on Skyrim? With the release of Skyrim&amp;rsquo;s special edition that brings the game to PS4 and Xbox One, we decided to invite former Bethesda Softworks lead programmer Brett Douville in for a conversation about programming the game. As seen above, the chat was particularly illuminating, since as Douville explained, the best language a programmer can know isn&amp;rsquo;t any coding language, but as he puts it &amp;ldquo;English&amp;rdquo;-meaning just having the ability to communicate with other team members and translate game design concepts into code and back. It turns out that even while Skyrim proved to be a huge programming challenge, it was also a lesson for Douville and his colleagues to just figure out how to take care of themselves and work together as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of two students and one professor from Brooklyn College won the grand prize of $10,000 at the NYC Media Lab Summit at Columbia University on Sept. 22. Computer Science Professor Neng-Fa Zhou, first-year graduate student Jie Mei, and programmer Jonathan Fruhman brought home the prize for their demo of a programming language called Picat. &amp;ldquo;Picat is a multi-paradigm programming language aimed for general-purpose applications, which means theoretically it can be used for everything in life,&amp;rdquo; said Mei. Mei, on the other hand, worked on programming during his years in college. Mei, along with his teammates at the University of Michigan, finished a project called Creative AI. They applied a neuro-linguistic programming concept &amp;ldquo;To develop models of a music artist&amp;rsquo;s lyrics so that the model would receive lyric data as input and ultimately generates new random lyrics in the style of that artist,&amp;rdquo; said Mei. Even though both Mei and Zhou have completed and worked on many successful projects, they were surprised to learn they won the grand prize. According to Picat&amp;rsquo;s website, the language incorporates the features of many other computer languages so users can solve problems more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that the latest release of Nim, version 0.15.2, is now available! As always, you can grab the latest version from the downloads page. This release is a pure bugfix release fixing the most pressing issues and regressions of 0.15.0. The list below has been generated based on the commits in Nim&amp;rsquo;s git repository. As such it lists only the issues which have been closed via a commit, for a full list see this link on Github. &amp;ldquo; Fixed &amp;ldquo;Internal error when passing parameter proc inside. Gcsafe closure&amp;rdquo; Fixed &amp;ldquo;Upcoming asyncdispatch doesn&amp;rsquo;t compile with C++ backend on OS X&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The types t and t1 don&amp;rsquo;t matter as the arguments aren&amp;rsquo;t used in the function body. The IO-action type results from print&amp;rdquo;Treat&amp;rdquo;, which prints &amp;ldquo;Treat&amp;rdquo; to StdOut. It&amp;rsquo;s type is val :: t -&amp;gt; which is executed when the program is run. To determine whether main equals putStr&amp;rdquo;Trick&amp;rdquo;, both sides have to be evaluated and both must have the same type, as SML is statically typed. Print has the type string -&amp;gt; unit, so putStr has the type a -&amp;gt; unit and therefore putStr&amp;rdquo;Trick&amp;rdquo; has just type unit. In order to be well-typed, main must have type unit too. So first the types of putStr and main are shown, then the expressions gets evaluated causing treat to be printed, then the value of the expression (true as both sides of = are ( is bound to the implicit result variable it which is then also displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IOCCC was inspired by Steve Bourne when he decided touse the C preprocessor to write his Unix shell in a syntax of C more like Algol-68 with explicit end statement cues where you have code like. IF *s2++ == 0 THEN return(0); FI. As Expert C says about this kind of code;. Is unix a keyword? Is it somehow printing the variable name? Searching the gcc source code, I find that it&amp;rsquo;s a run-time target specification. So unix wasn&amp;rsquo;t the name of an array variable, but how does 1[] work? I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this before and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite facts about C. C has origins in the langauge BCPL. From Dr. Martin Richards, creator BCPL;. The monodic indirection operator ! takes a pointer as it&amp;rsquo;s argument and returns the contents of the word pointed to. If v is a pointer !(v+I) will access the word pointed to by v+I. The dyadic version of ! is defined so that v!i = !(v+I). V!i behaves like a subscripted expression with v being a one dimensional array and I being an integer subscript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another rust code counting tool called tokei, loc is ~2-10x faster than tokei, depending on how many files are being counted. I can count my 400k file src directory in just under 7 seconds with loc, in a 1m14s with tokei, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even willing to try with cloc. Loc: 1.09 seconds tokei: 5.3 seconds cloc: 1 minute, 50 seconds Installation. For anyone familiar with Rust there&amp;rsquo;s cargo install loc. Fortran has a rule that comments must start with the first character of a line. X = &amp;ldquo;/* I haven&amp;rsquo;t slept for 10 days because that would be too long */&amp;ldquo;;. loc counts the first line and last lines correctly as code, but the middle lines will be incorrectly counted as comments. This project contains code from Tokei by Aaronepower and ripgrep by BurntSushi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on the frontend of our application however, I found TDD difficult to do and less satisfying than with backend code. The first two points above I will very much take blame for and not fault TDD, especially given my comparative inexperience with frontend coding at the beginning of our project. Humans are hard to predict So this brings us to the biggest problem with TDD and frontend code. As an aside, folks who are just getting started in coding and/or not used to TDD who don&amp;rsquo;t understand where it shines often don&amp;rsquo;t see the point of using it. What is the frontend and how do we test it then?So up to this point, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the word frontend to describe a thing that&amp;rsquo;s hard to TDD. If you&amp;rsquo;re a web developer though, do not think that everything you have running in your user&amp;rsquo;s browser is hard to test or is even frontend code. Not everything running in the browser is hard to test or even frontend codeBecause a lot of business logic running in a browser or other client is so close to the UI, you may get the impression that it&amp;rsquo;s all hard to use TDD with. Tell me I&amp;rsquo;m wrong and show me the wayI love practicing TDD. I would love to be wrong about this, so please share your experiences below about how you have figured out how to do TDD with user interfaces that doesn&amp;rsquo;t end up with throwing away most code immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around 4am that night, after several hundred lines of Basic code, I had myself a fully working Tetris-like. It&amp;rsquo;s only a few days later that I realized I had written the same kind of program, twice, twenty years apart and in two different but somewhat similar languages. About the time it took: Surprisingly with improved tools and an extra 20 years experience, it took me about the same time this time around as it did 20 years ago. Have they been lying to us all these years telling us that with improved tools we are able to write code faster? From this experience I would say &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;. About the size of the code: the code I wrote this time is roughly one third of the size of my original code which probably means it has less bugs and is more maintainable. In shorter terms, the code I ended-up with in 2016 is way more re-usable than the one from 1996. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve been rambling on and on about 2 different Tetris games coded 20 years apart, you probably want to see the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive Oracle v. Google litigation has entered a new phase, as Oracle filed papers yesterday saying it will appeal its loss on &amp;ldquo;Fair use&amp;rdquo; grounds to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. For a brief recap of the case: after Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems and acquired the rights to Java, it sued Google in 2010, saying that Google infringed copyrights and patents related to Java. Oracle initially lost but had part of its case revived on appeal. The sole issue in the second trial was whether Google infringed the APIs in Java, which the appeals court held are copyrighted. Oracle&amp;rsquo;s appeal is no surprise, but it will be a long shot. Oracle&amp;rsquo;s post-trial motions, which the district court judge rejected, indicate the tack it might try to take on appeal. Unless Oracle pulls off a stunning move on appeal, its massive legal expenditures in this case will be for naught.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns Out, Not Much &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to workplace design expert Alan Hedge at Cornell, 74 percent of workers say they face &amp;ldquo;Many&amp;rdquo; instances of disturbances and distractions from noise. The University of California&amp;rsquo;s Center for the Built Environment has a study showing workers are happier when they are in enclosed offices and less likely to take sick days. It&amp;rsquo;s only months later, when he was moved to a new desk in an office reshuffling, that he realized just how much more work he accomplished without constant interruption. In a previous job, Dooley shared an office with a man who liked to eat frozen carrots and had the hacking cough of someone with chronic bronchitis. While employers worry about contagion and lost productivity of someone bringing an illness to work, they also have a legal obligation to accommodate employees who have an illness or a disability. Four years ago, the Social Security Administration reprimanded a worker for his &amp;ldquo;Excessive flatulence.&amp;rdquo; After numerous complaints and warnings, the agency charged him with &amp;ldquo;Conduct unbecoming a federal employee.&amp;rdquo; The employee claimed he had lactose intolerance, and after his union intervened, the reprimand was rescinded. The trend toward open offices and hard office furniture makes noise distraction worse, so adding carpet, drapes and upholstery can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good / usable location is important for the meetup and the location depends on the meetup content. If you a running your meetup in a small conference room with ~15 people you often don&amp;rsquo;t need this. Try to motivate people from your community and local meetup to get on stage for the first time. If your meetup is well known, sometimes speaker will contact you, because they knew that it is possible to test bigger conference talks at local usergroups and improve them later. Name of the meetup WiFi access Office / location rules Where are the toilets Announcements of other appointments like other meetups in the area conferences / hackathons near by your next meetup Speaker and topic of today If you offer a socialising after the talk or if the meetup ends directly. If you run a meetup or visit meetups on a regular basis, feel free to share your lessons learned in the comments. Found a bug in this article?

      <title>How to become an enterprise developer and other personal rants ?</title>
      <link>http://iszlai.github.io/post/how-to-become-an-enterprise-developer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 13:27:23 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://iszlai.github.io/post/how-to-become-an-enterprise-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all this is a personal post with lot of questions, insecurities and rants. Really any answer reply&amp;rsquo;s, tweet, PM, email anything would be useful and help me at this point. But first let me give a bit of a background of how I got to this stage in the first place.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve studied programming since highscool all throughout University I had a CS major so I have/had the basics covered. While in Uni they hired me as a &amp;ldquo;Test automation engineer&amp;rdquo; but what I ended up doing was mostly manual testing with very little coding (or thinking by the way) &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/qa.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;QA&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
with continuous promises of getting in the development side. Which never came, so one day almost after a year of getting fed up I decided I would move on.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to another city get a job at a respected international financial firm and went trough their graduate program. It was wonderful they really tried their best to teach us about all the low level intricate details of *nix systems and C/C++ differences and idioms and a short introductory to function side with a bit of Scala.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the program we where pre-placed in teams ,and although I always had more affinity for backend related task and technology someone decided I will do Flash/Flex development on a huge system but with the promise I&amp;rsquo;ll get to work the backend as well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since and almost all I did was UI development and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit me, while I rarely had the chance but everytime I could do any minor change on the Java backend I was really happy. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong it was hard with virtually any experience with a 500k lines of code base.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/feel.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Feel&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 It was/is really hard to find way trough it. Since it is a 6 years+ old project most of the original team has moved on and any bit of documentation outdated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my best to learn the theory and I can say fairly confident that I know how dependency injection works, I can use Spring and can modify the components based on the code that&amp;rsquo;s already present. I know how ORMs work and even wrote a toy one for myself at home just to get a deeper understanding. I read a lot about and in theory know and understand design patterns.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my problem is that certain thing just don&amp;rsquo;t click in my mind. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly the why&amp;rsquo;s. Why are there factories everywhere, why are there builders upon builder, things like AbstractProxyBeanFactory and the like make me hold my head and scream. Why are things like VisitorAdapter (just like this ) defined. Why and who thought SOAP was a good a idea to communicate with integration partners.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/legacy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Knowledge&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 I find my self lost with no guidance at all, I rarely get to write code in the backend and feel that my home pet projects are not enough to learn certain things like this.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my questions are as follows:
How to learn ,to understand and to get better at this type of code? I thought about open source but find it really heard to contribute to anything meaningfull. It&amp;rsquo;s either also huge without anybody to ask, or I&amp;rsquo;ve read here or there that they are impatient with new people, or all they have time for is a readily made pull request.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final question is on a related ,topic is should a try to master Java more or focus on more new and trendy stuff ?Thing is I really feel like this &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/aprox.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Knowledge&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
,and feel like I really should try to focus on one thing just don&amp;rsquo;t really know on what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After starting with Java, Scala, C++ or any other language you probably start using an ide, well there are many out there for everyones personal preferences I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly focus on Eclipse.It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source IDE, mostly provided in Java, but it supports other the development languages by being extended with plug-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;turn-on-line-numbers&#34;&gt;Turn on line numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems trivial but it&amp;rsquo;s really useful when you work on a team or want to find something at a specific line. All you have to do is right click the gutter and choose &lt;strong&gt;Show line numbers&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple tip but often useful and you only have to do it once.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/lineNum.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Show line numbers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-to-line&#34;&gt;Go to line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly you see a line number inside a log regarding an Exception all you do is fire up go to line using &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+L&lt;/strong&gt; type the line number and hit enter.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/gotoLine.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Go to line&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;settings-search&#34;&gt;Settings search&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse is a huge platform and is continually growing it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to find keep in mind where you can find the appropriate settings. Luckily theres a search for the settings.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try to find the JRE settings as it&amp;rsquo;s commonly needed. So all you do is go to settings which can be found at &lt;strong&gt;Window&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; and type what you are searching for like &lt;strong&gt;JRE&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/settingsSearch.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Settings&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;type-hierarchy&#34;&gt;Type hierarchy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to know the whole supertype tree of a class of a class or to find the abstract type ? Using supertype hierarchy with &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt; .
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/supertype.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Supertype&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comment-out-a-block&#34;&gt;Comment out a block&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in a hurry you want to check something out, and don&amp;rsquo;t want the change to last, you could just easily comment out a block using &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;Shift&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;.
After you&amp;rsquo;re done repeat the same to undo it. This is also available for majority of languages so don&amp;rsquo;t have to type &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in xml ever again.Side note never leave commented out code blocks in code, it&amp;rsquo;s messy and it makes the code harder to read, and there really is no reason to keep it anyway thats what the source control is for.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/comment.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Comment&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extract-method&#34;&gt;Extract method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While refactoring you find a huge chunk of code that really should be a a method. So you could just create a method copy the chunk out, figure out the parameters and make it work. Or you could the IDE do most the work and just check the result. All you do is &lt;strong&gt;Alt&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;Shift&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; and give a method name.As you can see eclipse really does a pretty fine job on it&amp;rsquo;s own and saves you a lot of time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/extract.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Extract method&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;delete-a-line&#34;&gt;Delete a line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you just have it when there are empty lines in the wrong place ? Using &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; you delete the current line, it&amp;rsquo;s really like Vim&amp;rsquo;s DD command if that ain&amp;rsquo;t a reason to love it, i don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/delete.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Delete a line&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-references&#34;&gt;Find references&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to change something but you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure if it&amp;rsquo;s used by anything else or what else might be affected. In this case all you do is &lt;strong&gt;Right-click&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;scope&lt;/strong&gt; (like workspace, project, etc)
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/refferences.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;References&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;generate-code&#34;&gt;Generate code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often you find yourself writing a bit boiler plate code like getters/setters, toString, simple constructors.All this can be done by eclipse for you in a pretty find grained matter. All you do is &lt;strong&gt;Right-click&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;+what code you want to generate.
You can choose things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getters and Setters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hashCode() and equals()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toString()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bit can make you really productive but also please be careful don&amp;rsquo;t let the IDE make design decisions for you if you don&amp;rsquo;t need it don&amp;rsquo;t add it it will be just a cluttered code.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/generate.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Generate&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-resource&#34;&gt;Open resource&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are working on a project with hundreds of files packages and a complex structure if you have sort of memory about what a file is called you can try opening it with open resources .To use it all you need is &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;Shift&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; ,and name in which you can also use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; for any character match and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; any string match
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/openRes.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Open resources&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-declaration-implementation&#34;&gt;Open declaration/implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see a method or an object and you would like to know where it&amp;rsquo;s declared or where it&amp;rsquo;s implemented you just hold down &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;click&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/openDec.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Open declaration/implementation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search in eclipse is really powerful and has many functionalities to cover all of them it would take quite a lot.The two main things I would like to point out are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search and replace in file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical file search and replace theres not a lot to talk about it. All you do is &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; and then the usual functionality you would expect is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search workspace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more powerful search with filtering capabilities on file type and search scope.I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live without it on a windows box it&amp;rsquo;s almost as good as &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; .To use it all you need is &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://iszlai.github.io/images/searchH.gif&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Search&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My primary interest is to learn how to design software systems, so as to maximize the productivity of development teams. In doing this I try to look at current technological landscape and investigate software with good design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grew up in Marosvasarhely, Romania when to Babeş-Bolyai University
Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. My dissertation was about JavaScript based grid computing. During the time I was an intern at a mobile development company where I did Android development and have worked at an outsource firm where I did test automation. After graduating a moved to Budapest, Hungary where I started to work at a leading financial institution, trough which I had a chance to learn at the international offices in New York and London.&lt;/p&gt;
